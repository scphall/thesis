\section{Physics beyond the Standard Model}

Despite its countless successes,
there are many experimental and theoretical arguments indicating that the SM is an incomplete
picture of particle physics.
Many theoretical problems arise from the idea of naturalness, that is that...

%Experimental observations that are it is well known that the SM is incomplete; arguments for this
%come from both the experimental and theoretical
%leaves some experimentally observed phenomena unexplained.
Experimentally, there are observed phenomena which are left unexplained by the SM.
Neutrinos are treated as massless in the SM, but they are seen to oscillate in flavour space
indicating that they must, in fact, have mass.
Flat rotation curves of galaxies and gravitational lensing indicate the existence of Dark Matter,
which is entriely unaccounted for by the SM.
%Shortcomings include the
% credence
%For example the SM does not explain: gravity, dark matter, dark energy, and neutrino masses.

Another problem is that the SM cannot reconcile the matter-antimatter asymmetry observable in the
Universe today.
The hypothesized process which caused this asymmetry is known as baryogenesis.
%Baryogenesis is the term for a hypothesized process which resulted in the matter-dominated nature of
%the Universe.
Whatever this process may be, it must satisfy:
\begin{itemize}
  \item at least one baryon number (B) violating process,
  \item Charge and Charge-Parity (CP) violation,
  \item interactions out of thermal equilibrium.
\end{itemize}
These are the Sakharov conditions~\cite{1991SvPhU..34..392S}, and outline the minimum requirements
of baryogenesis.
The first of these criteria is an obvious one: at the time of the Big Bang $B=0$, whereas today
$B\gg0$; hence $B$ must not be conserved in some process.
If a process conserves charge then
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma(X\to Y+B)=\Gamma(\bar X \to \bar Y+\bar B),
\end{equation}
so $B$ will be conserved over time.
However, this condition is insufficient.
Consider a process $X\to q_Lq_L$ which has a CP-conjugate process $\bar X\to \bar q_R\bar q_R$;
then
\begin{equation}
  \Gamma(X\to q_Lq_L) + \Gamma(X\to q_Rq_R)
  =
  \Gamma(\bar X\to \bar q_R\bar q_R) + \Gamma(\bar X\to \bar q_L\bar q_L)
\end{equation}
would still result in $B$ conservation even if C is violated.
Thus, the process must be CP violating.
The final criteria ensures that baryogenesis occurs at a higher rate than anti-baryogenesis.
%Clearly the process must result in the violation of baryon number, and it must happen out of
%thermal equilibrium otherwise the process would occur equally as often in each direction.
%The third condition, CP violation (CPV) means that
%$\Gamma(A+B\to C)\neq\Gamma(\bar A + \bar B \to \bar C)$, so the annihilation of the products of
%the interaction cannot washout the asymmetry.

As discussed, the flavour sector is the only source of CPV in the SM, but comes up short by around 10 orders of
magnitude when explaining the matter dominated nature of the Universe~\cite{Cline:2006ts,Huet:1994jb}.
%There is therefore a powerful reason to believe that NP enters the flavour sector.
%The following chapter will elucidate as to how the flavour sector is the only source of CPV in the
%SM.
