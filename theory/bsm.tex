\section{Physics beyond the Standard Model}
%flavour structire of yukawa scouplings is not constrained by gauge invariance, which in turn
%implies that quark masses and their mixing are free parpameterrrs of the theoruy,

Despite its countless successes there are a plethora of indications, both theoretical and
experimental, that there exists additional physics, beyond the SM.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Experimental
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%There are many experimental phenomena which point to the existence of New Physics (NP).
One experimental phenomena that points to NP is the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe, and
the fact that it cannot be explained by the SM.
The amount of CP voilation from the phase in the CKM matrix comes up short by approximately ten
orders of magnitude~\cite{Cline:2006ts,Huet:1994jb}.
%This deficit is an indication of physics beyond the SM, and any discrepancies in UT measurements
%could be indicative of where this NP lies.
%While the flavour sector is the only source of CPV in the SM, it is approximately ten orders of
%magnitude too small to explain the matter dominated nature of the
%Universe~\cite{Cline:2006ts,Huet:1994jb}.
%Aside from the insufficient amount of CPV in the SM,
%This deficit is an indication of physics beyond the SM, and there are many other experimental
%phenomena which point to the same conclusion.
Also, the total mass of luminous matter constitutes less than $5\,\%$ of the
total mass in the Universe, hinting at the existence of Dark Matter.
Dark Matter is further evidenced by flat rotation
curves~\cite{1970ApJ...159..379R,1980ApJ...238..471R} and the gravitational lensing around the
Bullet Cluster~\cite{Markevitch:2003at}.
Furthermore, the SM cannot explain massive neutrinos, which are necessary to explain neutrino
oscillations, which were first observed unambiguously at
Super-Kameokande~\cite{PhysRevLett.81.1562}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Theoretical
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Theoretical reasons to suspect that the picture of particle physics outlined by the
SM is incomplete are often rather subjective, and revolve around the idea of natrualness.
Naturalness is a concept whereby a theory is deemed to be natural, or more plausible, if it has few
free parameters, all of which are of order one.
This leads to a host of contradictions.
The SM is not a natural theory.


There are a total of 18 free parameters in the SM, 13 of which reside in the flavour sector.
The CKM matrix in $\Lag{\it q}^\mathrm{CC}$ exhibits a strongly hierarchic structure, favouring
flavour conserving weak interactions.
%This can not be explained naturally.
Neither can the range of quark masses, which vary by four orders of magnitude.

Unnatural models with parameters which differ wildly in magnitude tend to result in fine-tuning.
This is when some parameters, or process, must cause a cancelation to extremely high preciesion in
order to agree with experimental observations.
For example, quantum loop corrections to the Higgs mass are of the order $10^{19}$ for Higgs mass
of $\sim125\gev$~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012ufa,Aad:2012tfa}.
This means that the cancellations required to achieve a mass comparable to the masses of the weak
vector bosons must be exact to 17 orders of magnitude.
This is known as the hierarchy problem.
%and has no natural explanation.

Fine tuning also appears in QCD, the Lagrangian for which looks like:
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{QCD} &=
  \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{QCD}^\mathrm{kin} +
  \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{QCD}^\mathrm{mass} +
  \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{QCD}^\theta \\
  \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{QCD}^\theta &=
  -\frac{n_fg^2}{32\pi^2}\theta F_{\mu\nu}\widetilde F^{\mu\nu}.
  %&= -\frac14F_{\mu\nu}\tilde F^{\mu\nu}
  %&-&\frac{n_fg^2\theta}{32\pi^2}F_{\mu\nu}\tilde F^{\mu\nu}
  %&+&\bar\psi\left(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu-me^{i\theta^\prime\gamma_5}\right)\psi\\
  %&= -\frac14F_{\mu\nu}\tilde F^{\mu\nu}
  %&-&\mathcal{L}_\theta
  %&-&\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{mass}.
\end{align}
The term $\mathcal{L}_\theta$ conserves Charge symmetry, but violates Parity and Time conjugation
invariance~\cite{Peccei:2006as}.
Thus, $\mathcal{L}_\theta$ violates CP.
However, we know from the current experimental upper limit of the neutron electric dipole moment
\cite{Baker:2006ts},
$|d_n <2.9\e{-26}\,e\mathrm{cm}$ (at 90\% CL) that the value of $\theta$ is less than $10^{-9}$
where it can be in the range $[0,2\pi]$.
This fine tuning is referred to as the strong CP problem.


%The SM has a total of 18 free parameters, 13 of which are in the flavour sector, and there are four
%orders of magnitude separating the mass of the up quark from that of the top.
%Another problem is that the Higgs mass has been observed to
%be $\sim125\gev$~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012ufa,Aad:2012tfa}, where quantum
%loop corrections are of the order of $10^{19}$, the Planck scale.
%This means that the cancellations required to achieve a mass comparable to the masses of the weak
%vector bosons must be exact to 17 orders of magnitude.
%This is known as fine tuning, and has no natural explanation.

A way to remove this occurrence of fine tuning would be the addition of NP particles which
contribute to the loop corrections and reduce the magnitude of the cancellation.
Loops also appear in FCNC processes in the SM, and because particles within these loops can be
virtual, precise measurements of FCNCs can be the ideal arena for NP searches.


In order to reconcile our understanding of particle physcs it is important to discover the
solutions to the aforementisoed problems.
This thesis looks in different places for evidence of NP: indirect measurements (tree and loop) and
a direct search.



The flavour sector...
Flavour physics offers an excellent environment to search for NP.

  \item New models introduce FV and CPV
  \item many parameters

LHCb is good for this...


%These processes can be parameterised by an effective Lagrangian, which is applicable up to some
%energy scale, $\Lambda$:
%\begin{equation}
  %\Lag{eff} = \Lag{SM} + \sum\frac{c_i^{(d)}}{\Lambda^{d-4}}\mathcal{O}_i^{(d)}.
%\end{equation}

%Coefficients c are dimensionless and independent of the energy scale.

%Strong bounds on $\Lambda$ for generic c, of order 1 (naturla ness)

%\begin{equation}
  %%\Lag{eff} = \Lag{SM} + \sum\frac{c_i^{(d)}}{\Lambda^{d-4}}\mathcal{O}_i^{(d)}
  %\Lag{eff} = \Lag{SM} + \sum\frac{c_i^{(d)}}{\Lambda^{d-4}}\mathcal{O}_i^{(d)}
%\end{equation}



%The most natural couplings are of order one.



%%\subsection{FCNCs}
%Since the SM is such a good description of physics at energy scales that have been probed to date,
%it is resonable to assume that this diverges at some cut off energy scale, $\Lambda$.
%This scale can be set based on the solution of the hierarchy problem, which indicates that
%$\Lambda$ should be less than a few TeV.
%A bound can also be set on $\Lambda$ by considering processes which are absent from SM processes at
%tree level, such as flavour changing neutral currnents (FCNCs).
%This results in a value of $\Lambda$ which far exceeds the few TeV from solving the hierarchy
%problem.
%The conflict between these two determinations is named the \emph{Flavour Problem}.
%
%The most pessimistic solution to the flavour problem is \emph{Minimal Flavour Violation} (MFV)
%which simply assumes that beyond SM physics follows a Yukawa coupling like structure in the flavour
%sector, this would lead to no discernable new physics in the flavour sector.














%A solution of the strong CP problem is to introduce a chiral $U(1)$ symmetry which is spontaneously
%broken and effectively replaces the CP violating angle $\theta$ with a CP conserving field.


%indicates that the SM is an incomplete picture of partilce physics.
%one of many reasons to believe that the SM is incomplete.
%But, there are other experimental phenomena which indicate
%unexplained by the SM, including gravity, dark matter and
%massive neutrinos.


%Furthermore

%Apart from the significant deficit in the amount of CPV supplied by the SM with respect to the
%amount required for a matter dominated Universe; there are a host of experimental reasons to
%suspect that the SM is incomplete.
%These include: the existence of gravity; the fact that the luminous matter totals less than $5\,\%$
%of the mass in the Universe; and that neutrinos have mass.

%Theoretical motivations for physics beyond the SM primarily revolve around the concept of
%naturalness.
%Naturalness is an entirely subjective concept, but generally a natural theory has coupling
%strengths of $\mathcal{O}(1)$ and few free parameters.
%The SM is deemed to be an unnarural theory because of the vast difference in energy that separates
%the weak from

%The SM is deemed to have probels with natural

%Despite its countless successes,
%there are many experimental and theoretical arguments indicating that the SM is an incomplete
%picture of particle physics.
%Many theoretical problems arise from the idea of naturalness, that is that...
%
%%Experimental observations that are it is well known that the SM is incomplete; arguments for this
%%come from both the experimental and theoretical
%%leaves some experimentally observed phenomena unexplained.
%Experimentally, there are observed phenomena which are left unexplained by the SM.
%Neutrinos are treated as massless in the SM, but they are seen to oscillate in flavour space
%indicating that they must, in fact, have mass.
%Flat rotation curves of galaxies and gravitational lensing indicate the existence of Dark Matter,
%which is entriely unaccounted for by the SM.
%%Shortcomings include the
%% credence
%%For example the SM does not explain: gravity, dark matter, dark energy, and neutrino masses.
%
%Another problem is that the SM cannot reconcile the matter-antimatter asymmetry observable in the
%Universe today.
%The hypothesized process which caused this asymmetry is known as baryogenesis.
%%Baryogenesis is the term for a hypothesized process which resulted in the matter-dominated nature of
%%the Universe.
%Whatever this process may be, it must satisfy:
%\begin{itemize}
  %\item at least one baryon number (B) violating process,
  %\item Charge and Charge-Parity (CP) violation,
  %\item interactions out of thermal equilibrium.
%\end{itemize}
%These are the Sakharov conditions~\cite{1991SvPhU..34..392S}, and outline the minimum requirements
%of baryogenesis.
%The first of these criteria is an obvious one: at the time of the Big Bang $B=0$, whereas today
%$B\gg0$; hence $B$ must not be conserved in some process.
%If a process conserves charge then
%\begin{equation}
  %\Gamma(X\to Y+B)=\Gamma(\bar X \to \bar Y+\bar B),
%\end{equation}
%so $B$ will be conserved over time.
%However, this condition is insufficient.
%Consider a process $X\to q_Lq_L$ which has a CP-conjugate process $\bar X\to \bar q_R\bar q_R$;
%then
%\begin{equation}
  %\Gamma(X\to q_Lq_L) + \Gamma(X\to q_Rq_R)
  %=
  %\Gamma(\bar X\to \bar q_R\bar q_R) + \Gamma(\bar X\to \bar q_L\bar q_L)
%\end{equation}
%would still result in $B$ conservation even if C is violated.
%Thus, the process must be CP violating.
%The final criteria ensures that baryogenesis occurs at a higher rate than anti-baryogenesis.
%%Clearly the process must result in the violation of baryon number, and it must happen out of
%%thermal equilibrium otherwise the process would occur equally as often in each direction.
%%The third condition, CP violation (CPV) means that
%%$\Gamma(A+B\to C)\neq\Gamma(\bar A + \bar B \to \bar C)$, so the annihilation of the products of
%%the interaction cannot washout the asymmetry.
%
%As discussed, the flavour sector is the only source of CPV in the SM, but comes up short by around 10 orders of
%magnitude when explaining the matter dominated nature of the Universe~\cite{Cline:2006ts,Huet:1994jb}.
%%There is therefore a powerful reason to believe that NP enters the flavour sector.
%%The following chapter will elucidate as to how the flavour sector is the only source of CPV in the
%%SM.
