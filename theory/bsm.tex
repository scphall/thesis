\section{Physics beyond the Standard Model}
\label{sec:bsm}

For a long time the completion of the \sm was reliant on the discovery of the Higgs boson.
Finally, in 2012, the \cms~\cite{Chatrchyan:2008aa} and \atlas~\cite{Aad:2008zzm} detectors
observed a Higgs boson with a mass of $m_H\simeq125\gev$~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012ufa,Aad:2012tfa}.
This final piece of the picture has made the \sm a remarkably robust theory with no predictions
deviating significantly from experimental observations.
Indeed, the theory of \QED~--- which describes interactions between
photons and charged particles in the \sm --- is one of the most accurate theories yet constructed.
The coupling constant in \QED is the fine structure constant, $\alpha$, which has been measured
experimentally to be~\cite{PDG2012}
\begin{align}
  \alpha^{-1}_\mathrm{exp} &= 137.035\,999\,074\,(44), \nonumber\\
  \intertext{and predicted theoretically to be~\cite{Aoyama:2012wj}}
  \alpha^{-1}_\mathrm{th} &= 137.035\,999\,073\,(35). \nonumber
\end{align}
These measurements have precisions which are better than one part per billion.

%\end{align}

Despite its countless successes, there are a plethora of indications --- both
experimental and theoretical --- that additional physics exists, \bsm.


\subsection{Failures and inconsistencies of the Standard Model}
\label{sec:bsm:fail}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Experimental
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
There are some phenomena that have been observed experimentally which cannot be explained by the
\sm.
Oscillations of neutrinos in flavour space mean that they must have mass; this is not accounted for
the \sm framework.
Neither are the observations of the \BAU and \dm.

% CPV
The \sm cannot reconcile the matter-antimatter asymmetry observed in the
Universe today.
The hypothesized process which caused this asymmetry is known as baryogenesis.
Whatever this process may be it must satisfy the three Sakharov
conditions~\cite{1991SvPhU..34..392S}, which outline the minimum requirements for baryogenesis.
The first, most obvious, criteria is that baryogenesis must violate baryon number.
The second Sakharov condition is that both \gls{C} and \CP are violated.
Lastly, baryogenesis must occur out of thermal equilibrium.
While the \sm does contain \CPV, it is approximately ten orders of
magnitude~\cite{Cline:2006ts,Huet:1994jb} too small to explain the \BAU.
%Other pressing problems in the \sm are that it cannot reconcile massive neutrinos, gravity, or the
%amount of mass that is not accounted for in the Universe.
In \Chap{ch:dsphi} a measurement of the \CP-asymmetry in the decay \btodsphi is made in an effort
to explain the \BAU.


% DARK MATTER
It is well known that the vast majority of mass in the Universe is unaccounted for.
Luminous matter totals only \approx$4.9\pc$ of the Universe~\cite{Adam:2015rua,PDG2014}, and the rest
is known only as \dm (\approx$26.8\pc$) and dark energy (\approx$68.3\pc$).
Dark Matter is an old and well motivated concept with the first evidence found in 1939 by H.~W.~Babcock
in the form of flat galactic rotation curves~\cite{1970ApJ...159..379R,1980ApJ...238..471R}.
Since then, corroborating evidence from, for example, gravitational lensing around the Bullet
cluster~\cite{Markevitch:2003at}, and the Cosmic Microwave Background, have given further credence
to its existence.

The theory of \SUSY naturally supplies a \dm candidate in the shape of the lightest supersymmetric
particle, which is stable because of the imposed conservation of $R$-parity.
\SUSY is a theory which introduces an additional super-particle for each \sm fermion and
gauge boson, whose spin differs by a half integer.
The Higgs sector in \SUSY comprises four Higgs doublets; two are spin-0 and two are spin-$\tfrac12$,
and then there are two each for $Y=\pm\tfrac12$.
After \SUSY is broken there are five Higgs physical scalar particles, two are \CP-even ($h^0$,
$H^0$); one is a \CP-odd scalar ($A^0$) and two are charged ($H^\pm$).
%It also immediately solves the hierarchy problem because for every \sm particle that contributes to
%the Higgs mass, a \SUSY particle also contributes, but with the opposite sign.
Unfortunately, masses of the super-particles are unconstrained, and could be anywhere between a few
TeV and the Planck scale.

Observations of \dm can also be used to motivate \bsm models which include \emph{dark sectors}.
A dark sector is a name for a particle, or group of particles, which is gauged under a
different gauge group to the \sm particles and therefore cannot interact with them directly.
There are a plethora of such models, but generally dark particles can only interact with the \sm
via weakly interacting messenger particles, which could be either vector or scalar.
In generality, these are known as \emph{Dark Bosons}.

Some excitement was caused by a hint of a dark sector messenger particle from the Hyper-\CP
experiment~\cite{Burnstein:2004uk}, which observes three $\decay{\Sigma^+}{p\mumu}$ events which
survive a stringent selection.
These three events also peak in the invariant mass of the dimuon pair.
The narrowness of this peak is indicative of a two body decay, consistent with  $\decay{\Sigma^+}{pP^0}$
and the subsequent decay of the \np particle via $\decay{P^0}{\mumu}$, where
$m_{P^0}=214.3\pm0.5\mev$~\cite{Park:2005eka}.
The $P^0$ could be the supersymmetric Goldstino, or a dark boson from many other theories.

\glspl{FCNC} are heavily suppressed in the \sm.
Firstly, they are forbidden at tree level; secondly, loop level diagrams are suppressed by factors
coming from the \ckm matrix.
These low background signatures provide ideal environments in which to search for \bsm physics,
since new massive off-shell particles can contribute to the loops and cause significant deviations
from \sm expectations.

This thesis documents a search for a \np particle in the dimuon spectrum of \btokstrmumu in
\Chap{ch:db}.
Also detailed, in \Chap{db:hhh}, is an observation of a high statistics \fcnc decay,
which could be used for future \np searches.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Theoretical
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Theoretical shortcomings of the \sm include: its inability to incorporate gravity at the quantum
scale, the existence of dark energy.
However, theoretical reasons suggesting \bsm physics
are often rather subjective and revolve around the idea of \emph{naturalness}.
Naturalness is a concept whereby a theory is deemed to be natural, or more plausible, if it has few
free parameters, all of which have a magnitude $\mathcal{O}(1)$.
The \sm is not a natural theory.
For example: there are a total of 18 free parameters in the \sm, 13 of which reside in the flavour
sector.
The \ckm matrix is strongly hierarchic
%--- favouring flavour conserving weak interactions ---
and the quark masses vary by four orders of magnitude.

One of the fundamental parameters of the \sm  is \V{ub} and it is therefore important to accurately
measure it.
This parameter is particularly interesting because it is the source of the largest
tension in the \ut.
A determination of \V{ub} can be made using inclusive and exclusive measurements of semi-leptonic
$\decay{B}{X_u\ell\bar\nu_\ell}$ decays; where $X_u$ is some meson containing a \uquark quark.
Inclusive measurements are made difficult by large
$\decay{B}{X_c\ell\bar\nu_\ell}$ backgrounds, while exclusive semi-leptonic modes suffer from
theoretical uncertainties.
A value of $\left|\V{ub}\right|$ can also be obtained from the annihilation decay
$\decay{\Bp}{\taup\nu_\tau}$, but this suffers from low statistics.
Determinations of \V{ub} from these sources are:
\begin{align}
  &&\left|\V{ub}\right|_\mathrm{exc}
  &= \big(4.41\,^{+0.21}_{-0.23}\big)\e{-3}
  & \text{\cite{PDG2014}}& \nonumber\\
  &&\left|\V{ub}\right|_{\makebox[\widthof{$_\mathrm{exc}$}][l]{$_\mathrm{inc}$}}
  &= \big(3.28\pm{0.29}\big)\e{-3}
  & \text{\cite{PDG2014}}&\nonumber\\
  &&\left|\V{ub}\right|_{\makebox[\widthof{$_\mathrm{exc}$}][l]{$_{\tau\nu}$}}
  &= \big(4.22\pm{0.42}\big)\e{-3}  &
  \bam{Update} \text{\cite{PDG2012}}.&
  %%|\V{ub}| &= \big(4.22\pm{0.42}\big)\e{-3}  & \big(\decay{\Bp}{\taup\nu_\tau}\big)\text{\cite{{PhysRevD.88.031102}&\nonumber
  \label{eq:th:vub}
\end{align}
There are tensions between the inclusive and exclusive modes, which are expected to be identical,
and could therefore hint at a source of \np.
A more accurate value of \V{ub} from the decay $\decay{\Bp}{\taup\nu_\tau}$ might shed light on the
situation.
Current measurements of angles and side lengths of the \ut, from \Ref{Charles:2015gya}, are shown
in \Fig{fig:th:ckmfitter}.
This figure also shows
global \V{ub} measurements from the semi-leptonic and $\decay{\Bp}{\taup\nu_\tau}$
modes are shown alongside one another.
%measurements also shows current global fit of Limits on \ut measurements are shown in
%\Fig{fig:th:ckmfitter}, and

    ($\left|\V{ub}\right|_\mathrm{SL}$) is given separately to a value obtained using
    $\BF\left(\decay{\Bp}{\taup\nu_\tau}\right)$, ($\left|\V{ub}\right|_{\tau\nu}$).

Unnatural \np models with parameters that differ wildly in magnitude tend to
lead to parameters or processes that must cancel to absurdly
high precision in order to agree with experimental observations.
These precise cancellations are known as \emph{fine tuning}.
In the \sm, quantum loop corrections to the Higgs mass are of the order $10^{19}$
for $m_H\simeq125\gev$~\cite{Chatrchyan:2012ufa,Aad:2012tfa}.
This means that the cancellations required to result in a Higgs mass comparable to the masses of
the weak vector bosons must be exact to 17 orders of magnitude.
This instance of fine tuning is known as the \emph{hierarchy problem}.
A solution for the hierarchy problem would be to introduce \np particles, whose contributions to
loop level processes reduce the magnitude of fine tuning required to a level that might be deemed
acceptable.
The theory of \SUSY immediately solves the hierarchy problem because for every \sm particle that
contributes to the Higgs mass, a \SUSY particle also contributes, but with the opposite sign.

Fine tuning also appears in \QCD.
A gauge invariant term that can be added to \Lag{QCD} is
\begin{equation}
  \Lag{QCD}^\theta = \theta\frac{g^2}{32\pi^2}
  G_{\mu\nu}^\alpha\widetilde G^{\mu\nu}_\alpha,
  \label{eq:strongcp}
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ and $g$ are constants, and $\alpha$ indicates a sum over colours.
The operator $G_{\mu\nu}$ is the gluon field strength tensor, and
\begin{equation}
  \widetilde G^{\mu\nu}_\alpha = \frac12\varepsilon_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}G^{\rho\sigma}_\alpha.
\end{equation}
Interactions in $\Lag{QCD}^\theta$ would conserve \gls{C} symmetry, but violate both \gls{P} and
\gls{T} conjugation~\cite{Peccei:2006as}.
Such symmetry violations contradict the observed properties of the strong
force.
Bounds placed on the value of the neutron dipole moment, $|d_n| <2.9\e{-26}\,\mathrm{ecm}$
(at 90\% CL)~\cite{Baker:2006ts} require $\theta$ to be very small,
$\theta<10^{-19}$~\cite{Crewther:PQref9}, when \emph{a priori} it could be in the range
$0<\theta<2\pi$.
This occurrence of fine tuning is referred to as the \emph{strong \CP problem}.

Despite the evidence for \bsm physics and the list of problems that must be solved, its precise
manifestation is unknown.
There are numerous theories concerning NP scenarios which seek to solve various problems.

%Some models have a \emph{dark} or \emph{hidden} sector which, apart from gravity, only
%communicates with the visible sector feebly via messenger particles.
%These messenger particles could potentially be observed after they decay into \sm particles after
%mixing with a $H$, $Z$, $\gamma$ or $\nu$.
A solution to the strong \CP problem is to introduce an additional chiral symmetry, such that
$\theta$, in \Eq{eq:strongcp}, becomes a field: the quanta of which are called \emph{axions}.
These axions could be the messenger particle between a dark and visible
sector~\cite{Peccei:2006as}.

Some searches look directly for evidence of NP, this is the case for the analysis detailed in
\Chap{ch:db}, where a new particle, \db, is searched for in the dimuon invariant mass spectrum of
\decay{\Bd}{\Kstarent\mumu} consistent with \decay{\db}{\mumu}.
This is sensitive to a range of models which predict a light particle with a mass in the range
$2m_\mu\lesssim m_\db\lesssim4000\mev$, such as the axion model.
It is also sensitive to the $P^0$ that was hinted at by the Hyper-\CP experiment.

Instead of counting on NP to behave in an expected way, it is possible to search in a model
independent manner by exploring general physics couplings.
To do this it is useful to introduce the \OPE~\cite{PhysRev.179.1499}.
