\section{Theoretical uncertainties in flavour physics}

Searches for BSM physics rely on the comparison of experimental measurements to theoretical
predictions for SM processes.
Unfortunately, theoretical predictions for QCD are very difficult.


Description of the strong interaction,

confinement

asymptotic freedom

form factors

peturbative qcd

lattice

quantitatice tests of non-peturbative qcd are few, becaise predictions are harder to make.

form factor is a function that gives propertices of a certain particle interaction without
including all of the underlying physics.
it is meaaasured wcperimentally wthen a theoretical calculation is unabvailable or too difficult...
