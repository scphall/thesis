%Another indication of physics beyond the SM is that the Higgs mass ($\sim125\gev$) is close to the
%mass of the $W$ and $Z$ bosons.
%This means that loop level corrections.
%New physics contributing to these loops with the opposite sign to SM processes decrease the amount
%of fine tuning required.
%Particles entering into Higgs mass correction loops will enter in the same way into other loop
%processes.
%
%Particles from NP models con contribute


%As previously stated, there are no vertices exhibiting flavour changing neutral currents (FCNCs) in the SM.
%However, FCNCs can occur in loops diagrams.
%Because particles in these loops can be virtual, such processes have access to much higher mass
%scales than the energy supplied by the collision (by the Pauli exclusion principle).
%Therefore contributions from very massive particles can contribute...
%These particles will contribute to the amplitude of the overall interaction, such that loop level
%interactions...



%\section{The Flavour problem}
%It is natural to assume that the SM is only valid up to some energy scale $\Lambda$, where the
%value of the cut-off is undetermined.
%Using the argument of the hierarchy problem suggests that $\Lambda$ should be less than a few \tev.
%\bam{Motivates FCNCs}
%Beyond SM physics can be characterized by a general effective Lagrangian:
%\begin{equation}
  %\Lag{eff} = \sum_{n>2} \frac1{\Lambda^n}C_i\matho_i.
%\end{equation}
%Here, $\matho_i$ is an effective operator parameterizing the genera






%Therefore the
%Flavour changing neutral currents are forbidden, GIM...









%It is unknown how NP will manifest itself...

%FCNCs are forbidden...

%The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics explains interactions of fundamental particles and
%forces.
%It is a remarkably successful theory, which predicted the existence of a scalar Higgs boson which
%was discovered by the \cms and \atlas collaborations in 2012.
%The SM also predicts the value of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $a_\mu$, which is in
%agreement with experimental results to five decimal places:
%\begin{align*}
  %%frac{g_\mu-2){2}
  %a_\mu^\mathrm{exp} &= \left(1165920.80 \pm 0.63\right)\e{-9} \\
  %a_\mu^\mathrm{th}  &= \left(1165918.41 \pm 0.48\right)\e{-9}.
%\end{align*}
%Despite these successes it is well known that the SM is incomplete, for it fails in several
%important points, for example: gravity is not included; neither dark matter, nor dark energy, is
%included; and neutrinos are treated as massless particles.
%Another problem is that the matter-antimatter asymmetry observable in the Universe cannot be
%reconciled by the SM.

%One can write the Lagrangian

%\section{Testing the flavour sector of the SM}
%There are convincing/powerful/... reasons that

%If new physics were to enter as a CPV phase in the flavour sector of the SM, this would be seen in
%measurements of the angles and sides of the UT.
%The total particle physics Lagrangian can be written as:
%\begin{equation}
  %\Lag{Tot} = \Lag{SM} + \Lag{NP}.
%\end{equation}
%Additional CP-violating phases in \Lag{NP} would cause the triangle not to close, such that
%$\alpha+\beta+\gamma\neq\pi$.
%Therefore it is vital to measure the CKM matrix elements to as high a precision as possible in as
%many ways as possible.
%The current constraints on the UT are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:th:ut2}.


%Diagonal elements of the CKM matrix are all known to high fractional precision...


%However, for all this, the SM fails to explain many phenomena:
%\begin{itemize}
  %\item There is no treatment for gravity.
  %\item There is no explanation for Dark Matter.
  %\item There is no explanation for Dark Energy.
  %\item Neutrinos are treated as massless.
  %\item Observed matter-antimatter asymmetry observable in the Universe.
%\end{itemize}

%There is no treatment
%\begin{itemize}
  %\item Quick overview of QED and QCD
  %\item All good, except for masses...
  %\item Then EWSB, new and full Lagrangian $B\vec{W} \to ZAW$
  %\item This parameterizes the behavior of all known particles to astounding accuracy
  %\item Masses are generated for $W, Z$ and not $\gamma$
  %\item Also get lepton \& quark masses
  %\item CKM matrix!
  %\item Wolfenstein parameterization
  %\item UT
  %\item CPV phase
  %\item Importance of measuring these parameters
  %\item Current status (CKM fitter/UTfit)
  %\item Trees and Loops
  %\item Incompleteness of SM - dark matter etc.
  %\item Also search for new physics directly (dark sector)
  %\item (Maybe MFV and why top quarks dominate in loops)
%\end{itemize}
%Done... All other theory can be handled in the specific analysis chapters.



%Spinor fields are (potentially) directly observable by experiment and obey the Dirac equation:
%\begin{equation}
  %(i\hbar\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu - mc)\psi = 0.
  %\label{th:eq:dirac}
%\end{equation}
%Therefore these particles, which are quanta of spinor fields, obey Fermi-Dirac statistics and are
%known as fermions.
%The fermions of the SM constitute six leptons (electron, muon, tauon and three corresponding
%neutrinos), and six quarks (up, down, charm, strange, top and bottom).
%Each fermion has an antiparticle with opposite charge (including neutrinos despite the fact they
%are neutral).
%Quanta of the vector and scalar fields obey Bose-Einstein staisitics and are the force carriers for
%the fundamental forces.
%These force mediators include the scalar Higgs boson, eight vector gluons of the string force and
%the vector $\gamma$, $W$ and $Z$ throught which the electroweak forces are mediated.
%
%
%Before SSB:
%This spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry directly  affects \Lag{Yuk}
%(Eq.~\ref{eq:th:lag}), which describes interactions between fermionic fields and the Higgs.
%It is not possible to dir...
%Before SSB the Yukawa coupling term for the quarks is:
%After this spontaneous symmetry breaking, the massive gauge bosons get a mass and the photon
%remains massless (as shown in Eq.~\ref{eq:th:lag}); it also affects \Lag{Yuk}.
%The Yukawa couplings describe the interactions of $\Phi$ with fermions:
%\begin{equation}
  %\Lag{Yuk} =
  %- \sum_{\substack{\ell= \\ e,\mu,\tau}}g_\ell\left(\bar\chi_L\Phi \ell_R + \bar \ell_R\Phi^\dagger\chi_L\right)
  %- y_{ij}^u\bar Q_L^i\Phi u_R^j
  %- y_{ij}^d\bar Q_L^i\tilde\Phi d_R^j + \mathrm{h.c.}.
%\end{equation}
%%Where $L$ and $R$ denote chiral fields,   % Define chiral fields earlier...
%Where $g_\ell$ and $y_{ij}^{u,d}$ are coupling constants and
%other terms are defined as:
%\begin{align}
  %\tilde\Phi_i &= \varepsilon_{ij}\Phi_j &
  %\chi_L &= \begin{pmatrix}\nu_L \\ \ell_L \end{pmatrix} &
  %Q_)L &= \begin{pmatrix}u_L \\ d_L \end{pmatrix}
%\end{align}
%for $u=u,c,t$ and $d=d,s,b$.
%After SSB and the Higgs potential acquires a VEV, \Lag{Yuk} can be split into an interaction term
%and a mass term, where the interaction term defines couplings between fermions and the Higgs
%($H\bar\psi\psi$), and the mass term is:
%\begin{equation}
  %\Lag{Yuk,mass} =
  %-\sum_{\ell=e,\mu,\tau}g_\ell\frac{v}{\sqrt{2}}
  %\left(\bar\ell_R\ell_L + \bar\ell_L\ell_R\right)
  %-\frac{v}{\sqrt{2}} y_{ij}^u\bar u_L^iu_{R,j}
  %-\frac{v}{\sqrt{2}} y_{ij}^d\bar d_L^id_{R,j},
  %%\mathrm{so} m_{u,d} = \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}}y_{ij}^{u,d}.
%\end{equation}
%and the mass of the quarks is given by the mass matrix
%$m^{u,d}_{ij} = \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}}y_{ij}^{u,d}$.
%This matrix can be diagonalized such that $m_{ij}^\mathrm{diag} = V_{Lik}m_{kl}(V_R^\dagger)_{lj}$
%which equates to rotating the left- and right-handed chiral quark fields with the matrices
%$V_L$ and $V_R$, respectively.
%Rotating the basis of quarks does not affect any of the mass or Higgs coupling terms of the quarks,
%but does change \Lag{q}:
%\begin{align}
  %\Lag{q}
  %&= \frac{g}{2}i\gamma^\mu
  %\left[\bar u_Ld_LW^+_\mu + \bar d_Lu_LW^-_\mu
  %\right] + \Lag{q}^\mathrm{NC} + \Lag{q}^\gamma \\
  %&\to \frac{g}{2}i\gamma^\mu
  %\left[
    %\bar u_L\left(V_{uL}V_{dL}^\dagger\right)d_LW^+_\mu +
    %\bar d_L\left(V_{dL}V_{uL}^\dagger\right)u_LW^-_\mu
  %\right] + \Lag{q}^\mathrm{NC} + \Lag{q}^\gamma.
%\end{align}
%Where $\Lag{q}^\mathrm{NC}$ and $\Lag{q}^\gamma$ are the weak neutral current and photon currents
%for quarks.
%These also remain invariant under the basis change, for example:
%\begin{align}
  %\Lag{NC}
  %&= i\sqrt{g^2+g^{\prime2}}
  %\left(
  %Z_\mu\bar u_j \gamma^\mu\left(g_v-\gamma_5g_A\right)u_j +
  %Z_\mu\bar d_j \gamma^\mu\left(g_v-\gamma_5g_A\right)d_j
  %\right)
  %\\
  %&\to i\sqrt{g^2+g^{\prime2}}
  %\left(
  %Z_\mu\bar u_j \gamma^\mu\left(g_v-\gamma_5g_A\right)\left(VV\right)u_j +
  %Z_\mu\bar d_j \gamma^\mu\left(g_v-\gamma_5g_A\right)\left(VV\right)d_j
  %\right)
  %\label{eq:th:nc}
%\end{align}
%where $VV=\mathbb{1}$ by unitarity.
%The matrix $V = \left(V_{uL}V_{dL}^\dagger\right)$ parameterizes the couplings between up- and
%down-type quarks in charged weak currents and is known as the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)
%matrix.
