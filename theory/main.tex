%Another indication of physics beyond the SM is that the Higgs mass ($\sim125\gev$) is close to the
%mass of the $W$ and $Z$ bosons.
%This means that loop level corrections.
%New physics contributing to these loops with the opposite sign to SM processes decrease the amount
%of fine tuning required.
%Particles entering into Higgs mass correction loops will enter in the same way into other loop
%processes.

%Particles from NP models con contribute

%As previously stated, there are no vertices exhibiting flavour changing neutral currents (FCNCs) in the SM.
%However, FCNCs can occur in loops diagrams.
%Because particles in these loops can be virtual, such processes have access to much higher mass
%scales than the energy supplied by the collision (by the Pauli exclusion principle).
%Therefore contributions from very massive particles can contribute...
%These particles will contribute to the amplitude of the overall interaction, such that loop level
%interactions...

%\section{The Flavour problem}
%It is natural to assume that the SM is only valid up to some energy scale $\Lambda$, where the
%value of the cut-off is undetermined.
%Using the argument of the hierarchy problem suggests that $\Lambda$ should be less than a few \tev.
%\bam{Motivates FCNCs}
%Beyond SM physics can be characterized by a general effective Lagrangian:
%\begin{equation}
  %\Lag{eff} = \sum_{n>2} \frac1{\Lambda^n}C_i\matho_i.
%\end{equation}
%Here, $\matho_i$ is an effective operator parameterizing the genera

%Flavour changing neutral currents are forbidden, GIM...

%It is unknown how NP will manifest itself...

%This figure shows two, slightly conflicting, constraints for the side
%$|\V{ud}\Vconj{ub}|/|\V{cd}\Vconj{cb}|$ coming from different measurements of \V{ub}.
%One of these is from inclusive measurements of \decay{B}{X_u\ell\nu_\ell}, and the other is from

    %contributions: inclusive and exclusive semileptonic decays (plain dark green)

%\section{Testing the flavour sector of the SM}
%There are convincing/powerful/... reasons that

%If new physics were to enter as a CPV phase in the flavour sector of the SM, this would be seen in
%measurements of the angles and sides of the UT.
%The total particle physics Lagrangian can be written as:
%\begin{equation}
  %\Lag{Tot} = \Lag{SM} + \Lag{NP}.
%\end{equation}
%Additional CP-violating phases in \Lag{NP} would cause the triangle not to close, such that
%$\alpha+\beta+\gamma\neq\pi$.
%Therefore it is vital to measure the CKM matrix elements to as high a precision as possible in as
%many ways as possible.
%The current constraints on the UT are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:th:ut2}.

%Diagonal elements of the CKM matrix are all known to high fractional precision...
