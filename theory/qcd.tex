Description of the strong interaction,

confinement

asymptotic freedom

form factors

peturbative qcd

lattice

quantitatice tests of non-peturbative qcd are few, becaise predictions are harder to make.

form factor is a function that gives propertices of a certain particle interaction without
including all of the underlying physics.
it is meaaasured wcperimentally wthen a theoretical calculation is unabvailable or too difficult...
