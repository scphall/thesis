%The \lhcb collaboration has published many interesting results involving a \decay{b}{s\mumu} FCNC,
%many of these involve the decay
%\decay{B}{K\mumu}~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2012-024,LHCb-PAPER-2012-021,LHCb-PAPER-2012-011}.
%transisiton with a spectator quark, and then the decay of the \Kstar.

%Recently there has been much interest surrounding an observed $3.7\stdev$ deviation from
%theoretial predictions in the value of an observable in the angular distribution of the decay
%\decay{\Bd}{\Kstarent\mumu}~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2013-037}.
%This decay proceeds via a \decay{\bquark}{\squark\mumu} FCNC where the other quark in the $B$ meson
%is a spectator.
%Analagous diagrams are possible, whereby additional quarks contribute to the final state
%forming either a $\kpipi\mumu$ or $\phik\mumu$ system.
%Figure~\ref{fig:hhh:feyn} shows ways that these final states might be formed from decaying $B$
%mesons.

%These final states have added challenges because they result from the decay of numerous strange
%resonances.

%This has additional interest in that, not only does it probe the FCNC, but the \kpipi system can
%result from the decay of numerous strange resonances.

The decays \btokpipimumu and \btophikmumu both proceed via \decay{\bquark}{\squark\mumu} FCNC
transitions, which are forbidden at tree level in the SM.
Therefore, these processes are potentially sensitive to NP contributing
to the decay amplitude as virtual particles in loops.

There are also similarities between the decay $\decay{\Bp}{K^*(892)^0\mumu}$, which has the final
state
$\kpi\mumu$ and the signal decays.
Both involve a \decay{\bquark}{\squark\mumu} transition and a spectator quark; but they differ in
the hadronization in to get the final state.
The decay $\decay{\Bp}{K^*(892)^0\mumu}$ is of considerable interest because, not only does it
involve an FCNC, but there are also angular distributions that are sensitive to NP.

The \kpipi system in the decay \btokpipimumu results from the decay of a variety of strange
resonances.
Contributions of resonances to the \kpipi system has been previously studied by the \belle
collaboration in the tree level decay \btojpsikpipi, where \jpsitomumu~\cite{Guler:2010if}.
This study indicated that the dominant contribution should be expected
to be from \decay{\kone{1270}}{\kpipi}.
The \kone{1270} meson, together with the \kone{1400}, are mass eigenstates resulting from the
mixing of the $P$-wave axial vector states $K_{1A}(1^3P_1)$ and $K_{1B}(1^1P_1)$ according to:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \ket{\kone{1270}} \\
    \ket{\kone{1400}}
  \end{pmatrix}
  =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \sinthetakone & \costhetakone \\
    \costhetakone & -\sinthetakone
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \ket{K_{1A}^+} \\
    \ket{K_{1B}^+}
  \end{pmatrix}.
  \label{eq:k1mixing}
\end{equation}
Here, \thetakone is the mixing angle and has been measured to be both $-34^\circ$ and
$-57^\circ$~\cite{PhysRevD.47.1252,Tayduganov:2011ui,Hatanaka:2008xj,Cheng:2011pb,Divotgey:2013jba,Cheng:2013cwa}.
However, more recent measurements favour a value of
$-(34\pm13)^\circ$~\cite{Hatanaka:2008xj,Cheng:2011pb,Divotgey:2013jba,Cheng:2013cwa}.

Due to the unknown composition of the $m_\kpipi$ spectrum an inclusive prediction of the branching
fraction $\BF(\btokpipimumu)$ does not exist.
However, the branching fraction of the rare decay \decay{\Bp}{\kone{1270}\mumu} is predicted to
be~\cite{Hatanaka:2008gu}
\begin{equation}
  \BF\big(\decay{\Bp}{\kone{1270}\mumu}\big) = \big(2.3\,^{+1.3}_{-1.0}\,^{+0.0}_{-0.2}\big)\e{-6},
\end{equation}
where uncertainties arise from form-factor calculations and the mixing angle, respectively.
The \kone{1270} then decays into the \kpipi final state, with a branching fraction of
$\BF\big(\decay{\kone{1270}}{\kpipi}\big)=\big(35.7\pm3.7\big)\,\%$~\cite{PDG2012}.

Figure~\ref{fig:th:thetak1} shows the theorecitcal \qsq distribution for the decay
$\decay{\Bp}{K_1^+\mumu}$ for both the \kone{1270} and \kone{1400} and varying \thetakone.
The \decay{b}{s\mumu} can be mediated by a real photon which, for some values of \thetakone, can be
transversely polarized.
However, for some values of \thetakone the \mumu pair is fully longitudinally polarized and the
decay via a photon is forbidden.

The decay $\Bp\!\to\phi(1020)\Kp\mumu$ where \decay{\phi}{\kk} has no branching fraction
predictions
\footnote{All mentions of the $\phi$ meson are implicitly
  referencing the $\phi(1020)$.
}.
The expected brnahcing fraction for the decay \btophikmumu is for it to be lower with respect to
that of \btokpipimumu, because it requires an \ssbar to be \emph{popped} from the vacuum.

Absent from this analysis are the searches for the decays \decay{\Bp}{\Kp\Km\pip\mumu}
and \decay{\Bp}{\pipi\pim\mumu}.
These were not included because they are suppressed by a factor of $|\V{td}/\V{ts}|^2\simeq23$ and
suffer from large backgrounds.

%One such FCNC transistion is that of \decay{b}{s\ell^+\ell^-}, which has the CKM matrix elements
%\V{tb} and \V{ts} in the leading order diagram.
%The lepton pair is a product of a decaying $Z$ or $\gamma$, by lepton universality all leptons are
%equally likely, however \lhcb is particularly adept at muon identification.
