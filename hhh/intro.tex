%The \lhcb collaboration has published many interesting results involving a \decay{b}{s\mumu} FCNC,
%many of these involve the decay
%\decay{B}{K\mumu}~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2012-024,LHCb-PAPER-2012-021,LHCb-PAPER-2012-011}.
%transisiton with a spectator quark, and then the decay of the \Kstar.

%Recently there has been much interest surrounding an observed $3.7\stdev$ deviation from
%theoretial predictions in the value of an observable in the angular distribution of the decay
%\decay{\Bd}{\Kstarent\mumu}~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2013-037}.
%This decay proceeds via a \decay{\bquark}{\squark\mumu} FCNC where the other quark in the $B$ meson
%is a spectator.
%Analagous diagrams are possible, whereby additional quarks contribute to the final state
%forming either a $\kpipi\mumu$ or $\phik\mumu$ system.
%Figure~\ref{fig:hhh:feyn} shows ways that these final states might be formed from decaying $B$
%mesons.

%These final states have added challenges because they result from the decay of numerous strange
%resonances.

%This has additional interest in that, not only does it probe the FCNC, but the \kpipi system can
%result from the decay of numerous strange resonances.

The decays \btokpipimumu and \btophikmumu both proceed via \decay{\bquark}{\squark\mumu} FCNC
transitions, which are forbidden at tree level in the SM.
Therefore, these processes are potentially sensitive to NP contributing
to the decay amplitude as virtual particles in loops.

The \kpipi system in the decay \btokpipimumu results from the decay of a variety of strange
resonances.
Contributions of resonances to the \kpipi system has been previously studied by the \belle collaboration
in the tree level decay \btojpsikpipi, where \jpsitomumu~\cite{Guler:2010if}.
This study indicated that the dominant contribution should be expected
to be from \decay{\kone{1270}}{\kpipi}.
The \kone{1270} meson, together with the \kone{1400}, are mass eigenstates resulting from the
mixing of the $P$-wave axial vector states $K_{1A}(1^3P_1)$ and $K_{1B}(1^1P_1)$ according to:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \ket{\kone{1270}} \\
    \ket{\kone{1400}}
  \end{pmatrix}
  =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \sinthetakone & \costhetakone \\
    \costhetakone & -\sinthetakone
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \ket{K_{1A}^+} \\
    \ket{K_{1B}^+}
  \end{pmatrix}.
  \label{eq:k1mixing}
\end{equation}
Here, \thetakone is the mixing angle and has been measured to be both $-34^\circ$ and
$-57^\circ$~\cite{PhysRevD.47.1252,Tayduganov:2011ui,Hatanaka:2008xj,Cheng:2011pb,Divotgey:2013jba,Cheng:2013cwa}.
However, more recent measurements favour a value of
$-(34\pm13)^\circ$~\cite{Hatanaka:2008xj,Cheng:2011pb,Divotgey:2013jba,Cheng:2013cwa}.

Due to the unknown composition of the $m_\kpipi$ spectrum an inclusive prediction of the branching
fraction $\BF(\btokpipimumu)$ does not exist.
However, the branching fraction of the rare decay \decay{\Bp}{\kone{1270}\mumu} is predicted to
be~\cite{Hatanaka:2008gu}
\begin{equation}
  \BF(\decay{\Bp}{\kone{1270}\mumu} = (2.3\,^{+1.3}_{-1.0}\,^{+0.0}_{-0.2})\e{-6},
\end{equation}
where uncertainties arise from form-factor calculations and the mixing angle, respectively.
The \kone{1270} then decays into the \kpipi final state, with a branching fraction of
$\BF(\decay{\kone(1270)}{\kpipi})=(35.7\pm3.7)\,\%$~\cite{PDG2012}.

The decay $\Bp\!\to\phi(1020)\Kp\mumu$ where \decay{\phi}{\kk} has no branching fraction
predictions
\footnote{All mentions of the $\phi$ meson are implicitly
  referencing the $\phi(1020)$.

%At low \qsq, the dominant contribution is from
%\emph{
%While the branching fraction of the radiative decay $\Bp\to K_1(1270)^+\gamma$ has been measured to
%be ${\cal B}(\Bp\to K_1(1270)^+\gamma)=(4.3\pm 1.3)\times 10^{-5}$~\cite{Yang:2004as}, the decay
%$\Bp\to K_1(1270)^+\mumu$ has not been observed yet.
%The SM prediction for the branching fraction of this mode is $\BF(\Bp\to K_1(1270)^+\mumu) =
%(2.3\,^{+1.3}_{-1.0}\,^{+0.0}_{-0.2})\e{-6}$~\cite{Hatanaka:2008gu} where the first uncertainty is
%due to the poorly known form factors and the second due to $\theta_{K_1}$.
%The radiative decay $\Bp\to\phi \Kp\gamma$ has been observed and its branching fraction measured to
%be ${\cal B}(\Bp\to\phi \Kp\gamma)=(3.4\pm 0.9 \pm 0.4)\times 10^{-6}$ by the \belle\
%collaboration~\cite{Drutskoy:2003xh}.

%One such FCNC transistion is that of \decay{b}{s\ell^+\ell^-}, which has the CKM matrix elements
%\V{tb} and \V{ts} in the leading order diagram.
%The lepton pair is a product of a decaying $Z$ or $\gamma$, by lepton universality all leptons are
%equally likely, however \lhcb is particularly adept at muon identification.


%The principal decay mode that results in the $\kpipi\mumu$ final state is
%\decay{\Bp}{K_1(1270)^+\mumu}, where \decay{K_1(1270)}{\kpipi}.

%The composition of the $\Kp\pip\pim$ spectrum of the decay $\Bp\to\jpsi\Kp\pip\pim$ has been
%previously studied in Ref.~\cite{Guler:2010if}.
%For the decay $\Bp\to\Kp\pip\pim\mup\mun$ the final state is expected to be dominated by
%contributions from the $K_1(1270)^+$ and $K_1(1400)^+$ resonances.
%The mass eigenstates $K_1(1270)^+$ and $K_1(1400)^+$ are a mixture of the $1^3P_1$ and $1^1P_1$
%states according to
%\begin{align}
  %\ket{K_1(1270)} &= \ket{K(1^3P_1)}\sin\theta_{K_1} + \ket{K(1^1P_1)}\cos\theta_{K_1},\nonumber\\
  %\ket{K_1(1400)} &= \ket{K(1^3P_1)}\cos\theta_{K_1} - \ket{K(1^1P_1)}\sin\theta_{K_1},%\\
  %\label{eq:k1mixing}
%\end{align}
%where $\theta_K$ denotes the $1^3P_1\text{--}1^1P_1$ %$K_1(1270)^+\text{--}K_1(1400)^+$
%mixing angle~\cite{Hatanaka:2008gu}.

%The branching fraction of \decay{\Bp}{K_1(1270)^+\gamma}
