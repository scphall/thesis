%The \lhcb collaboration has published many interesting results involving a \decay{b}{s\mumu} FCNC,
%many of these involve the decay
%\decay{B}{K\mumu}~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2012-024,LHCb-PAPER-2012-021,LHCb-PAPER-2012-011}.
%transisiton with a spectator quark, and then the decay of the \Kstar.

%Recently there has been much interest surrounding an observed $3.7\stdev$ deviation from
%theoretial predictions in the value of an observable in the angular distribution of the decay
%\decay{\Bd}{\Kstarent\mumu}~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2013-037}.
%This decay proceeds via a \decay{\bquark}{\squark\mumu} FCNC where the other quark in the $B$ meson
%is a spectator.
%Analagous diagrams are possible, whereby additional quarks contribute to the final state
%forming either a $\kpipi\mumu$ or $\phik\mumu$ system.
%Figure~\ref{fig:hhh:feyn} shows ways that these final states might be formed from decaying $B$
%mesons.

%These final states have added challenges because they result from the decay of numerous strange
%resonances.

%This has additional interest in that, not only does it probe the FCNC, but the \kpipi system can
%result from the decay of numerous strange resonances.

The decays \btokpipimumu and \btophikmumu both proceed via \decay{\bquark}{\squark\mumu} FCNC
transitions, which are forbidden at tree level in the SM.
Therefore, these processes are potentially sensitive to NP contributing
to the decay amplitude as virtual particles in loops.
%Figure~\ref{fig:hhh:feyn} shows the pengiun diagrams which propagate these decays in the SM.

The effective Hamiltonian for $\decay{b}{s\ell^+\ell^-}$ FCNCs is given by:
\begin{equation}
  \Ham{eff} = -4\frac{G_F}{\sqrt{2}}\Vconj{ts}\V{tb}\frac{e^2}{16\pi^2}
  \sum_{i=1}^{10}\big[C_i(\Lambda)\mathcal{O}_i(\Lambda)
    +C_i^\prime(\Lambda)\mathcal{O}_i^\prime(\Lambda)\big]
\end{equation}
as in \Eq{eq:th:opeham}. %, where the coefficients are known as Wilson coefficients, which
%correspond to the Wilson operators $\mathcal{O}_{1-10}$.
The operators $\mathcal{O}_{1-6}$ are sensitive to long distance contributions such as \ccbar
loops.
Operators which are particularly sensitive to NP contributions in \decay{b}{s\mumu} transitions are
\begin{align}
  \Op{7\pz} &= \frac{m_b}{e}\big(\bar\squark\sigma_{\mu\nu}P_Rb\big)F^{\mu\nu}
  %$\bra{f}\Op}\ket{i}$.
  &\Op{7\pz}^\prime &= \frac{m_b}{e}\big(\bar s \sigma_{\mu\nu}P_Lb\big)F^{\mu\nu}
  \nonumber\\
  %\mathcal{O}_8 &= g\frac{m_b}{e^2}\big(\bar s \sigma_{\mu\nu}T^aP_Rb\big)G^{\mu\nu a}
  %&\mathcal{O}_8^\prime &= g\frac{m_b}{e^2}\big(\bar s \sigma_{\mu\nu}T^aP_Rb\big)G^{\mu\nu a}
  %\\
  \Op{9\pz} &= \big(\bar s\gamma_\mu P_Lb\big)\big(\bar\ell\gamma^\mu\ell\big)
  &\Op{9\pz}^\prime &= \big(\bar s\gamma_\mu P_Rb\big)\big(\bar\ell\gamma^\mu\ell\big)
  \nonumber\\
  \Op{10} &= \big(\bar s\gamma_\mu P_Lb\big)\big(\bar\ell\gamma^\mu\gamma_5\ell\big)
  &\Op{10}^\prime &= \big(\bar s\gamma_\mu P_Rb\big)\big(\bar\ell\gamma^\mu\gamma_5\ell\big)

  %\mathcal{O}_{P} &= \frac{m_b}{m_{B_s}}\big(\bar s\gamma_\mu P_Rb\big)\big(\bar\ell\gamma_5\ell\big)
\end{align}
where $P_{L,R}$ are the left and right projection operators.
The operators \Op{7} and \Op{9} describe the emission of a photon or $Z$ from a penguin loop,
and \Op{10} corresponds to a box type diagram with \Wp; these are shown in \Fig{fig:hhh:loops}.
Primed operators are the suppressed helicity, whose contributions are vanishingly small in the SM.

The decay \btokpipimumu can propagate as shown in \Fig{fig:hhh:feyn}, this
has similarities with the decay $\decay{\Bp}{K^*(892)^0\mumu}$.
Both propagate in the same way, but the latter's final state is $\kpi\mumu$ --- the decay
\btokpipimumu requires an additional \uubar pair.
The decay $\decay{\Bp}{K^*(892)^0\mumu}$ is of considerable interest because, not only does it
involve an FCNC, but its angular distributions are sensitive to NP.

The \kpipi system in the decay \btokpipimumu results from the decay of a variety of strange
resonances.
Contributions of resonances to the \kpipi system has been previously studied by the \belle
collaboration in the tree level decay \btojpsikpipi, where \jpsitomumu~\cite{Guler:2010if}.
This study indicated that the dominant contribution should be expected
to be from \decay{\kone{1270}}{\kpipi}.
The \kone{1270} meson, together with the \kone{1400}, are mass eigenstates resulting from the
mixing of the $P$-wave axial vector states $K_{1A}(1^3P_1)$ and $K_{1B}(1^1P_1)$ according to:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \ket{\kone{1270}} \\
    \ket{\kone{1400}}
  \end{pmatrix}
  =
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \sinthetakone & \costhetakone \\
    \costhetakone & -\sinthetakone
  \end{pmatrix}
  \begin{pmatrix}
    \ket{K_{1A}^+} \\
    \ket{K_{1B}^+}
  \end{pmatrix}.
  \label{eq:k1mixing}
\end{equation}
Here, \thetakone is the mixing angle and has been measured to be both $-34^\circ$ and
$-57^\circ$~\cite{PhysRevD.47.1252,Tayduganov:2011ui,Hatanaka:2008xj,Cheng:2011pb,Divotgey:2013jba,Cheng:2013cwa}.
However, more recent measurements favour a value of
$-(34\pm13)^\circ$~\cite{Hatanaka:2008xj,Cheng:2011pb,Divotgey:2013jba,Cheng:2013cwa},
and the most recent rule out the soloution at $-57^\circ$~\cite{Divotgey:2013jba,Cheng:2013cwa}
(but with a different sign convention).



Due to the unknown composition of the $m_\kpipi$ spectrum an inclusive prediction of the branching
fraction $\BF(\btokpipimumu)$ does not exist.
However, the branching fraction of the rare decay \decay{\Bp}{\kone{1270}\mumu} is predicted to
be~\cite{Hatanaka:2008gu}
\begin{equation}
  \BF\big(\decay{\Bp}{\kone{1270}\mumu}\big) = \big(2.3\,^{+1.3}_{-1.0}\,^{+0.0}_{-0.2}\big)\e{-6},
\end{equation}
where uncertainties arise from form-factor calculations and the mixing angle, respectively.
The \kone{1270} then decays into the \kpipi final state
--- via both a non-resonant decay and various resonaces ---
with a branching fraction of
$\BF\big(\decay{\kone{1270}}{\kpipi}\big)=\big(35.7\pm3.7\big)\,\%$~\cite{PDG2012}.

Figure~\ref{fig:th:thetak1} shows the theorecitcal \qsq distribution for the decay
$\decay{\Bp}{K_1^+\mumu}$ for both the \kone{1270} and \kone{1400} and varying \thetakone.
The \decay{b}{s\mumu} can be mediated by a real photon which, for some values of \thetakone, can be
transversely polarized.
However, for some values of \thetakone the \mumu pair is fully longitudinally polarized and the
decay via a photon is forbidden.

The decay $\Bp\!\to\phi(1020)\Kp\mumu$ where \decay{\phi}{\kk} has no branching fraction
predictions
\footnote{All mentions of the $\phi$ meson are implicitly
  referencing the $\phi(1020)$.
}.
The expected brnahcing fraction for the decay \btophikmumu is for it to be lower with respect to
that of \btokpipimumu, because it requires an \ssbar to be \emph{popped} from the vacuum.

Absent from this analysis are the searches for the decays \decay{\Bp}{\Kp\Km\pip\mumu}
and \decay{\Bp}{\pipi\pim\mumu}.
These were not included because they are suppressed by a factor of $|\V{td}/\V{ts}|^2\simeq23$ and
suffer from large backgrounds.
