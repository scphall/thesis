\subsection{Selection}

Combine muons of opposite charge with three charged hadrons
reconstruced candidates must form vertex of good fit quality that is well separated from any pv in
an events
PID info from the RICH is used to identify final state hadrons
\kpipi system mass below 2400\mev
\kk within 12\mev of $m\phi$

PV chosen based on lowest PV of B candidateo

%vertex fit \chisq must increase by more than 121 when including the B candidate daughters

fit vertex chi2 < 6

angle between the B candidate momentum vector and the directon defined by the PV to B decay vertex
must be less than ... 14mrads

FD \chisq large, ie \chisq of having zero FD for B is large (121)

Backgorunds of \jpsi and \psitwos must be removed
also their radiative tails

main sources of peaking backgrounds come from charmonia
