\section[Branching fraction of the decay \btophikmumu]
{Branching fraction of the decay $\boldsymbol{\btophikmumu}$}

The branching fraction of the signal decay \btophikmumu is determined relative to the normalization
channel \btojpsiphik:
\begin{equation}
  \BF\big(\btokphimumu\big)=
  \frac{ N^\prime\big(\btophikmumu\big) }{ N\big(\btophikmumu\big) }
  \cdot\BF\big(\btojpsiphik\big)
  \cdot\BF\big(\jpsitomumu\big).
\end{equation}
Here, $N^\prime\big(\btophikmumu\big)$ denotes the number of signal events extracted from an
unbinned fit of \btophikmumu candidates, with each event weighted by the relative efficiency
$\varepsilon\big(\btojpsiphik\big) / \varepsilon_\qsq\big(\btophikmumu\big)$.
This is done because the efficiency of the decay \btophikmumu was shown to vary significantly over
the full \qsq range, the weights are determined in bins of \qsq.
The branching fraction measurements used were
$\BF\big(\btojpsiphik\big)=\big(5.2\pm1.7\big)\e{-5}$~\cite{PDG2012},
and $\big(\jpsitomumu\big)=5.93\pm0.06$~\cite{PDG2012}.

Yeilds for both the signal and normalization channels are extracted from unbinned maximum
likelihood fits of the invariant mass of the \Bp candidates.
The signal component for the normalization channel is the sum of two Gaussian functions, with a
power-law tail on the low mass side; the same function is used for fitting the weighted signal
distribution where all parameters are fixed from a fit to the high statistics normalization mode.
Combinatorial background is modelled as a second order Chebychev polynomail.
These fits give the values
$N^\prime\big(\btokphimumu\big)=25.2\,^{+6.0}_{-5.3}$ and
$N\big(\btojpsiphik\big)=1908\pm63$.

The above values lead to a measured branching fraction of
\begin{equation}
  \BF\big(\btophikmumu\big)=
  \big(0.81\,^{+0.18}_{-0.16}\stat\pm0.03\syst\pm0.27\normerr\big)\e{-7}.
\end{equation}
However, the charmonium vetoes remove $\big(2\,^{+10}_{-\pz2}\big)\,\%$ of signal events, as
calculated using simulated events.
Taking this into account results in a value of
\begin{equation}
  \BF\big(\btophikmumu\big)=
  \big(0.82\,^{+0.19}_{-0.17}\stat\,^{+0.10}_{-0.04}\syst\pm0.27\normerr\big)\e{-7}.
\end{equation}
The ratio of branching fractions of the signal and normalization channels is
\begin{equation}
  \frac{ \BF\big(\btophikmumu\big) }{ \BF\big(\btojpsiphik\big) }
  =\big(1.58\,^{+0.36}_{-0.32}\stat\,^{+0.19}_{-0.07}\syst\big)\e{-3},
\end{equation}
which is quoted because there are large relative uncertainties associated with the branching
fraction of the normalization channel ($\sim33\,\%$).

\subsection{Systematic uncertainties}
\label{ssec:phik:syst}

Sytematic uncertainties contributing to the measurement of $\BF(\btophikmumu)$ are determined in
very similar ways as for the measurement of $\BF(\btokpipimumu)$, as detailed in
\Sec{ssec:kpipi:syst}.
The uncertainties introduced by correcting the simulated events by weighting and resampling are
calculated in the same way as for the decay \btokpipimumu.
The systematic uncertainty arising from the signal mass model was evaluated by
subsituting the nominal double Gaussian with a power-law tail, for a single Gaussian with a tail
and recalculating the signal yield.
Similarly, the systematic from the background model is evaluated by repeating the fit with a first
order, rather than a second order, polynomial.
The uncertainty on the \qsq distribution in the simulation was estimated by reweighting the from
the nominal phasespace simulation to the distribution of the \decay{\Bp}{\kone{1270}\mumu} mode.
\bam{rew 1\%}
\bam{model 3\%}
\bam{limited stat on eff 1.5\%}
\bam{trigger 1.5\%}
\bam{\qsq 1.5\%}

The fraction of events that are removed by the charmonium vetoes are determined from simulation.
But, as discussed, the \qsq distribution that is described by the \btophikmumu simulation was
inaccurate since there is no theoretical prediction available.
To circumnavigate this problem, generator level simulated events is used to obtain the central
value.
Vetoed fractions are then calculated by generating events whose \qsq distribution is taken from the
\decay{\Bp}{\kone{1270}\mumu} decay, where the mass of the \kone{1270} system is replaced with an
estimated mass of the \phik system.
The value of $m_{\phik}=1960\mev$, which is taken fro the sWeighted $m_{\kpipi}$ distribution from
data.
In this way, it was determined that $(2\,^{+10}_{-\pz2})\,\%$ of signal events were removed by the
charmonium vetoes.
