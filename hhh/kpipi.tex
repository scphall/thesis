%Binning scheme in
      %decays~\cite{LHCb-PAPER-2013-017,LHCb-PAPER-2013-037,LHCb-PAPER-2013-019}.

Given the statistics available for this channel, the differential branching fraction,
$\dBF(\btokpipimumu)/\dqsq$ was calculated in bins of \qsq.
The differential branching fraction for a bin of width $\Delta\qsq$ is
%\begin{equation}
  %\frac{d}{\dqsq}\BF\left(\btokpipimumu\right)
  %=
  %\frac{\num{sig}}{\num{norm}} \cdot
  %\frac{\eff{norm}}{\eff{sig}} \cdot
  %\frac{\BF_\mathrm{tot}\left(\btopsitwosk\right)}{\Delta\qsq}
%\end{equation}
\begin{multline}
  \frac{d}{\dqsq}\BF\big(\btokpipimumu\big)=
  \\
  \frac{1}{\Delta\qsq} \cdot
  \frac{N\big(\btokpipimumu\big)}{N\big(\btopsitwosk\big)} \cdot
  \frac{\varepsilon\big(\btopsitwosk\big)}{\varepsilon\big(\btokpipimumu\big)} \cdot
  \BF_\mathrm{tot}\big(\btopsitwosk\big)
  \label{eq:kpipi:diffbf}
\end{multline}
where,
\begin{equation*}
  \BF_\mathrm{tot}\big(\btopsitwosk\big)
  =
  \BF\big(\btopsitwosk\big) \cdot
  \BF\big(\psitwostojpsipipi\big) \cdot
  \BF\big(\jpsitomumu\big),
\end{equation*}
\num{sig} is the yield of the signal decay \btokpipimumu in the given \qsq bin and \num{norm}
is the yield of the normalization channel.
Total deficiencies for reconstruction and selection are denoted by \eff{sig} and \eff{norm} for the
signal and normalization channels respectively.
The efficiency for each \qsq bin is shown in \Fig{fig:hhh:kpipieff}.

The normalization channel was chosen to be \btopsitwosk, where \psitwostojpsipipi and \jpsitomumu,
which has a total branching fraction of $(1.264 \pm 0.0052)\e{-5}$~\cite{PDG2012}.
This was chosen for the normalization channel over the decay \btojpsikpipi because it has a
relative uncertainty of $4\,\%$ rather than $16\,\%$ for $\BF(\btojpsikpipi) = (8.1\pm1.3)\e{-4}$.

The yield  of the normalization channel is extracted from an unbinned extended maximum likelihood
fit to the invariant mass distribution of \btopsitwosk candidates.
The function used to fit the data constitutes a signal and background component.
Signal candidates are modelled using the sum of two Gaussian functions, each having a power-law
tail at low-mass.
The parameters of the tail shared between the Gaussians, and all parameters are taken from a fit to
the high statistics mode of the cross-check channel \btojpsikpipi.
The background function is made of en exponential --- to model combinatorial background --- and a
Gaussian --- to model partially reconstructed candidates --- at low mass.
The same function is used to fit $m(\jpsi\kpipi)$ the control channel.
These fits are shown in \Fig{fig:kpipi:norm} and they yield
$N(\psitwos\Kp)=5128\pm67$ and $N(\jpsi\kpipi)=59\,335\pm343$.

%Just as in the signal fits, the normalization background is an exponential, but accounts to the
%partially reconstructed background at low mass with a Gaussian.
%Signal function is also a \bam{Something here}.
%The fitted invariant mass distribution for \btopsitwosk candidates is shown in
%\Fig{fig:kpipi:norm}, which yields $N(\psitwos\Kp)=5128\pm67$ normalization candidates.


Yields of the signal decay in regions of \qsq were extracted from fits using a distribution that
was fixed to as large an extent as possible.
The lower limit of the fit was taken to be $5150\mev$, because partially reconstructed background
is a problem below that.
The combinatorial background shape is an exponential distribution, where the exponent and yield was
allowed to float in the fit; however, in the regions where charmonium vetoes are effective, the
steps in the background are fixed using sideband data.
The signal function was also the sum of Gaussians with power law tails, where the parameters are
all fixed to the values from the fit to the cross-check channel.
Figure~\ref{fig:kpipi:q2fits} shows the invariant mass distribution for all \btokpipimumu
candidates for the whole \qsq region and for each bin.
The total yield of \btokpipimumu candidates is $N(\kpipi\mumu)=367\,^{+24}_{-23}$.

Differential branching fractions were calculated with \Eq{eq:kpipi:diffbf} where yields were
extracted from fits in \Fig{fig:kpipi:q2fits}.
These results are shown graphically in \Fig{fig:kpipi:diffbf} and are given numerically --- along
with signal yields --- are shown in \Tab{tab:kpipi:diffbf}.
The sum over all \qsq bins results in an integrated branching fraction of
\begin{equation*}
  \BF\big( \btokpipimumu \big)=
  \big(3.43\,^{+0.23}_{-0.21}\stat\pm0.15\syst\pm0.14\normerr\big)\e{-7};
\end{equation*}
where quoted uncertainties are statistical, systematic and due to the errors on the branching
fraction of the normalization channel.
The fraction of signal events removed by the charmonium vetoes is determined from simulated
\decay{\Bp}{\kone{1270}\mumu} events % changing the form factors
to be $(21.3\pm1.5)\,\%$.
Finally, the adjusted integrated branching fraction is
\begin{equation*}
  \BF\big( \btokpipimumu \big)=
  \big(4.36\,^{+0.29}_{-0.27}\stat\pm0.21\syst\pm0.18\normerr\big)\e{-7}.
\end{equation*}
The statistical significance of this result is in excess of $20\stdev$ according to Wilks'
theorem~\cite{wilks1938}.

Since the uncertainty due to the normalization channel branching fraction is significant, the
ratio of branching fractions is also quoted
\begin{equation*}
  \frac{ \BF\big( \btokpipimumu \big) }{ \BF\big( \btopsitwosk \big) } =
  \big(6.95\,^{+0.46}_{-0.43}\stat\pm0.34\syst\big)\e{-4}.
\end{equation*}
Where the value used is~\cite{PDG2012}
$\BF_\mathrm{tot}\big(\btopsitwosk\big)$,
and the uncertainty is fully correlated between \qsq bins.

\subsection[Systematic uncertainties for the decay \btokpipimumu]
{Systematic uncertainties for the decay \tmath{\btokpipimumu}}
\label{ssec:kpipi:syst}

Systematic uncertainties introduced to the measurement of the differential branching fraction of
\btokpipimumu can be categorised into three main categories:
corrections applied to simulated events,
the fits to the signal and normalization channels, and
modelling of the signal decay.
The following section describes the methods used to calculate systematic uncertainties from each
source.

% Reweighting and PID
Section~\ref{sec:hhh:eff} describes the process of correcting simulated events such that they best
describe data.
This procedure introduces systematic uncertainties which must be accounted for.
This is done by recalculating the relative efficiency for each \qsq bin:
without reweighting track multiplicity and $\chisqvtx(B)$;
without accounting for differences in tracking and {\tt isMuon} efficiencies;
and without performing PID resampling.
The resulting systematic uncertainty from the selection was assigned a value of $1\pc$.
Each source of uncertainty is treated separately, and the total systematic uncertainty is taken to
be the difference in the branching fraction with the newly calculated relative efficiency.
%\bam{selection 1\%}
%\bam{trigger 1\%}

% Fits
In order to assess the degree of uncertainty introduced by the distributions used to model the
signal and background components.
The systematic uncertainty is taken to be the difference between the nominal branching fraction,
and the branching recalculated using different signal or background components in the fit.
A single Gaussian with a power-law tail is used as an alternative signal model and --- in a
different fit --- a linear function is used to describe the background.
The modelling of the mass distributions led to a systematic uncertainty of $2\pc$.

The way the signal decay is modelled in simulation were the source of numerous systematic
uncertainties.
Efficiencies were calculated using simulated data using the model described in
\Ref{Hatanaka:2008gu}, but this is imperfect for a number of reasons.
This model mismatches the data in \qsq, $m_\kpipi$; it also assumes that $\thetakone=-34^\circ$,
and was used to determine the fraction of signal removed by charmonium vetoes.

To assess the systematic introduced by the difference between the \qsq distribution in data and
simulation a different decay model was used.
Rather than the efficiency for the signal channel being determined from simulated
\decay{\Bp}{\kone{1270}\mumu} generated with the model in \Ref{Hatanaka:2008gu}, it was decayed
using a phasespace model.
The differences in the invariant mass distribution of \kpipi cannot be assessed using simulation
because of the difficulties associated with theoretically describing \kpipi resonances.
Instead, the signal effiecincies are calculated after being reweighted to match the sWeighted
$m(\kpipi)$ distribution from signal, as shown in \Fig{fig:kpipi:kpipi}.
Systematic uncertainties from these two sources are assessed by redetermining branching fractions
using these new signal efficiencies.

The value of the mixing angle \thetakone has been a source of some theoretical contention, where
$\thetakone=-34^\circ$ or
$-57^\circ$~\cite{PhysRevD.47.1252,Tayduganov:2011ui,Hatanaka:2008xj,Cheng:2011pb,Divotgey:2013jba,Cheng:2013cwa}.
But, more recently measurements favour a value of approximately
$-(34\pm13)^\circ$~\cite{Hatanaka:2008xj,Cheng:2011pb,Divotgey:2013jba,Cheng:2013cwa}.
To estimate the systematic uncertainty associated with this value, the simulated data was
reweighted on an event-by-event basis such that the value of \thetakone was varied by $1\,\sigma$.
This was done by interfacing with \evtgen~\cite{Lange:2001uf} directly.

The probability of a particle decaying into a given final state is done in \evtgen using
a probability density function --- based on the decay model --- which is
dependent upon the momenta of the final state particles.
By calculating the probability of the decay with $\thetakone=-34^\circ$, and other angles, one can
reweight the simulated data to match data from any angles.

The signal efficiency was recalculated after varying the \thetakone by $1\,\sigma$ in simulated
\decay{\Bp}{\kone{1270}\mumu} events.
Branching fractions were then evaluated using these new efficiencies, and the maximum difference
from the nominally calculated value is taken as the systematic uncertainty.
The same procedure was used to calculate systematics with respect to $\thetakone=-57^\circ$, and
the values are found to be consistent with $-(34\pm13)^\circ$.
This led to an assigned uncertainty of
\bam{1-2\%}.

Charmonium vetoes removes a percentage of signal candidates, that must be accounted for in order to
calculate the total integrated branching fraction.
This fraction is subject to a systematic uncertainty due to the mismodelling of the \qsq
distribution in the simulated signal events.
Form factors in \Ref{Hatanaka:2008gu} gave the central value of $21.3\,\%$.
Vaying these form factors at generator level by a random number from a Gaussian distribution, whose
standard devatioin is the error on the form factor.
This is done multiple times and leads to an uncertainty of $1.5\,\%$.


%The trigger selection also introduces some systematic uncertainty...
