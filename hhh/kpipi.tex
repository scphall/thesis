\section{Differential branching fraction of the decay \btokpipimumu}

%Due to the high statistics of the decay \btokpipimumu, its braching fraction was also measured
%differentially, in bins of the invariant mass squared of the dimuon system (\qsq).

%Measurements pertaining to the decay \btokpipimumu were made with respect to the normalization
%channel \btopsitwosk, where \psitwostojpsipipi and \jpsitomumu.
%\begin{equation}
  %\BF\left(\b\right)
%\end{equation}





%The decay \btojpsikpipi was used for cross-checks
%These measurements were made with respect to the normalization channels
