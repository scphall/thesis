\section{Summary}
\label{sec:hhh:conc}

The two \fcnc decays \btokpipimumu and \btophikmumu were both observed for the first time.
Their branching fractions were measured to be:
\begin{align*}
  \BF\big( \btokpipimumu \big)&=
  \big(4.36\,^{+0.29}_{-0.27}\stat\pm0.21\syst\pm0.18\normerr\big)\e{-7}, \\
  \BF\big(\btophikmumu\big)&=
  \big(0.82\,^{+0.19}_{-0.17}\stat\,^{+0.10}_{-0.04}\syst\pm0.27\normerr\big)\e{-7}.
\end{align*}
Additionally, the differential decay rate of the decay \btokpipimumu was calculated with respect to
\qsq; these results are given in \Table{tab:kpipi:diffbf} and shown in \Fig{fig:kpipi:diffbf}.

Improvements could trivially be made after another measurement of
$\BF\big(\btojpsiphik\big)$ with reduced uncertainties.
For this reason, \Ref{LHCb-PAPER-2014-030} quotes the ratio of branching fractions.

Future measurements of these decays would benefit from additional statistics.
Particularly in order to understand the complex resonance structure observed in the hadronic
systems.
If one could begin to understand the structure of the \kpipi system, not only would make for
interesting spectroscopy measurements, but also it would give a handle on to the \kpipi angular
distributions.
This, in turn, would make \btokpipimumu sensitive to the same operators to \btokstrmumu.

Increased data would also allow measurements other three-hadron, two-muon final states.
Measurements of the branching fractions of the decays \decay{\Bp}{\pip\pipi\mumu} and
\decay{\Bp}{\kk\pip\mumu} would give access to the ratio of \ckm matrix elements $\V{td}/\V{ts}$.

The decay \btokpipimumu has a relatively large branching fraction, and could be used in future
searches for \np particles in the dimuon distribution: in a similar way to the analysis described
in \Chap{ch:db}.


%\begin{itemize}
  %\item Could in future normalize to \decay{\Bp}{\jpsi\Kstar}
  %\item Good to do resonant analysis, like in \decay{\Bp}{\kpipi\gamma}
  %\item Improve with different/better normalization channel
  %\item Conclude iwth statement that, given to relavtively large BF of \btokpipimumu, could in
    %future use to search for inflaton like particles!
  %\item Angular observables in this final state are not clean because of complex resonance
    %structure of the \kpipi system.
%\end{itemize}
