\section{Summary}
\label{sec:hhh:conc}

The two decays \btokpipimumu and \btophikmumu, which are both mediated by FCNCs, were both observed
for the first time.
Their branching fractions were measured to be:
\begin{align*}
  \BF\big( \btokpipimumu \big)&=
  \big(4.36\,^{+0.29}_{-0.27}\stat\pm0.21\syst\pm0.18\normerr\big)\e{-7}, \\
  \BF\big(\btophikmumu\big)&=
  \big(0.82\,^{+0.19}_{-0.17}\stat\,^{+0.10}_{-0.04}\syst\pm0.27\normerr\big)\e{-7}.
\end{align*}
Additionally, the differential decay rate of the decay \btokpipimumu was calculated with respect to
\qsq; these results are given in \Table{tab:kpipi:diffbf} and shown in \Fig{fig:kpipi:diffbf}.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Could in future normalize to \decay{\Bp}{\jpsi\Kstar}
  \item Good to do resonant analysis, like in \decay{\Bp}{\kpipi\gamma}
\end{itemize}
