AIM FOR 3 PAGES

This thesis presents two analyses undertaken using data collected by the \lhcb experiment
and a third to be completed, all
with the objective of using indirect and direct methods, to search for evidence of physics that is
inconsistent with our understanding of the \sm of particle physics.
These analyses found the first evidence for the decay \btodsphi, the first observations of the
decays \btokpipimumu and \btophikmumu, and the search for the decay of a dark boson into a dimuon
pair.

The first evidence of the decay \btodsphi was presented in \Chap{ch:dsphoi}, which is also the
first evidence of a fully hadronic annihilation-type decay.
The BF measured is in agreement with the sm predictions,
More about Vub, recent results?


\btokpipimumu \btophikmumu
potential in the future to measure vtd/vts, also another background free channel to look for a \db
FCNC, observables?

In conclusion,
consistency with the \sm

Nice plot of measurements from different experiments.
