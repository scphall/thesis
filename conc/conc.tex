This thesis presents two analyses undertaken using data collected by the \lhcb experiment
and a third to be completed, all
with the objective of searching for evidence of \bsm physics.
Each analysis looks for evidence in slightly different ways, and use either an indirect or direct
search approach.
%using indirect and direct methods, to search for evidence of physics that is
%inconsistent with our understanding of the \sm of particle physics.
%These analyses found the first evidence for the decay \btodsphi, the first observations of the
%decays \btokpipimumu and \btophikmumu, and the search for the decay of a dark boson into a dimuon
%pair.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Dsphi
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
An analysis of the decay \btodsphi was presented in \Chap{ch:dsphi}.
Measurements made in this analysis were sensitive to \np effects contributing at tree
level because it proceeds via an annihilation-type diagram, and is mediated by a virtual \Wp.
This gauge boson can be replaced by a range of charged bosons adding to the amplitude, leading to
an enhanced branching fraction.
Additional \np diagrams would also introduce a cross-term in the amplitude, and therefore an
observed non-zero \CP-asymmetry would be indicative of \np.

Branching fraction predictions for the decay \btodsphi are of order
$10^{-7}$~\cite{Zou:2009zza,Mohanta:2002wf,PhysRevD.76.057701,Lu:2001yz}.
However, this analysis resulted in a higher than expected branching fraction, but one that is
still compatible with the \sm since large uncertainties in the hadronic form factors make the
branching fraction very difficult to predict.
Of the six candidates that were nearest the \Bp mass, three were from a decaying \Bp, and three
were from a \Bm; meaning that there is zero \CP-asymmetry.
This value had to be corrected for known asymmetries from detector, and production effects, but
final value was still consistent with $\acp=0$.

Chapter~\ref{ch:hhh} presents an analysis leading to the first observations of the two decays
\btokpipimumu and \btophikmumu.
Theoretical predictions to these inclusive decay are made difficult by the structure of the strange
resonance states that contribute to the \kpipi and \phik systems.

The decay \btokpipimumu is a high statistics channel and could be used for future analyses similar to
those of interest in \btokstrmumu, since both are sensitive to the same operators.
An angular analysis would help constrain the scalar, pseudoscalar, and tensor amplitudes of the
decay, all of which are vanishingly small in the \sm, but this is made difficult by the number of
contributing states to the \kpipi system,
but with mode statistics it would perhaps be possible to gain a better understanding of these
strange states.
It would also be possible to use the dimuon distribution from \btokpipimumu to search for a dark
boson using the same method outlined in \Chap{ch:db}.
Although the invariant mass of the \kpipi system is, on average, larger than the \Kstarz mass,
there is still plenty of phasespace for the dimuon spectrum from \btokpipimumu to be interesting.
This is because as soon as the mass of the hypothetical dark boson is heavier than twice the mass
of the $\tau$ the branching fractions (in non-leptophobic models) plummet.
Therefore, regardless of the decay, it would not be expected to see a new particle in the diumon
spectrum above $m_\db=2m_\tau\simeq3554\mev$.

Given larger statistics, the additional channels \decay{\Bp}{\Kp\Km\pip} and \decay{\Bp}{\pip\pipi}
may be observable, and give access to the ratio $\V{td}/\V{ts}$ and be complimentary to the current
measurements from $B$-meson oscillations.
