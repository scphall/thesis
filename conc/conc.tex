AIM FOR 3 PAGES
REFERENCE THE SHIT OUT OF IT

This thesis presents two analyses undertaken using data collected by the \lhcb experiment
and a third to be completed, all
with the objective of using indirect and direct methods, to search for evidence of physics that is
inconsistent with our understanding of the \sm of particle physics.
These analyses found the first evidence for the decay \btodsphi, the first observations of the
decays \btokpipimumu and \btophikmumu, and the search for the decay of a dark boson into a dimuon
pair.

The first evidence of the decay \btodsphi was presented in \Chap{ch:dsphoi}, which is also the
first evidence of a fully hadronic annihilation-type decay.
The BF measured is in agreement with the sm predictions,
More about Vub, recent results?
ACP compatible with the \sm


\btokpipimumu \btophikmumu
First observations
potential in the future to measure vtd/vts, also another background free channel to look for a \db
high statistics
FCNC, observables?
angular distrbutions difficult
Strange resonance structures interesting


\btokstrdb
Sensitivity
Novel statistical techniques make this possible
Also selection
Most sensitive...
Probe regions of parameter space for various models



In conclusion,
consistency with the \sm

Nice plot of measurements from different experiments.
