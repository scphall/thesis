\section{Selection}

This analysis uses the full $3.0\invfb$ of data collected by the \lhcb
experiment~\Ref{Alves:2008zz} in the years 2011 and 2012 at 7 and $8\tev$ respectively.

Simulated samples for the decay \btokstrdb are used for a variety of \mass{\db} and $\tau_\db$, as
shown in \Table{tab:db:samples}.
Also used in this analysis, are simulated events of the decays \btokstrmumu and \btojpsikstr.

Simulated samples are extremely important for this analysis,




It is important to remove sources of background while leaving the invariant mass of the dimuon
distribution smoothly varying, so that the assumption of local-linearity remains.

In \Sec{sec:strategy} resonances are discussed, and those where $\Gamma<5\sigmam$ must be vetoed.
For this analysis,
