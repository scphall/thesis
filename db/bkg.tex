\subsection{Other backgrounds from particle misidentification}
\label{sec:db:backgrounds:misid}

Beyond backgrounds from onia states and the \KS decay there are many mesons that decay into a
two-body final state, which could mimic the signal decay given some particle misidentification.
A meson that decays via $\decay{X}{hh^\prime}$ which is then reconstructed
under the incorrect mass hypothesis could pass the selection criteria as either the \db or \Kstarz
candidate.
This type of contamination is studied by assigning different mass hypotheses to each final state
particle and calculating the invariant mass of the \mumu and \kpi candidates.
If the mass of one of these objects, after mass reassignment, is seen to peak at the mass of a
known particle, then the contamination is removed by applying \pid criteria.

Since a selection has been made on the \decay{\Kstarz}{\kpi} candidate using both \pid criteria and
constraints on the \kpi invariant mass it is expected that there will be little contamination
from background sources.
To test this, candidate \Kstarz mesons coming from a \Bd candidate with an invariant mass
within $80\mev$ of the known \Bd mass are assigned different mass hypotheses to check for peaking
components in the new $\mass{K_{h}^+\pi_{h^\prime}^-}$ mass spectrum.
%\footnote{
  %Where, as defined previously, the notation $h_i$ is a particle under the mass hypothesis of $h$
  %which was reconstructed as an $i$.
%}
The only background that must be removed from this category is from a real \decay{\phi}{\kk}
where a kaon in the final state is misidentified as being a pion.
If the mass of the $\Kp K^-_\pi$ candidate lies within $10\mev$ of the known \phii mass, the
ambiguous pion is subject to the requirements that
$\ProbNN{\pi}<0.3$ and $\ProbNN{K}>0.3$.

Resonances decaying into a pair of hadrons which are mistaken as a pair of
muons are more problematic.
%Misidentification of the decay \decay{\KS}{\pipi} is already dealt with in the preselection, but
Weak Decays of mesons can contribute to background, especially
\decay{\Dz}{\kpi} and \decay{\Lz}{p\pim}, which are dealt with in a similar way to the vetoes
described in \Chap{ch:dsphi}.
If the invariant mass of the $K^+_\mu\pi^-_\mu(p_\mu\pi^-_\mu)$ candidate falls within $25(10)\mev$
of the nominal $\Dz(\Lz)$ mass, then the muons are subject to the requirement that
$\ProbNN{\mu}(\Kp_\mu,\pip_\mu)>0.3(\ProbNN{p}(p_\mu)<0.3)$.

Misidentifying the proton as a pion in the decay \decay{\Lb}{p\Km\mumu} can contaminate the
selected \btokstrdb candidates.
Figure~\ref{fig:db:lb} shows the invariant mass distribution of the $p_\pi\Km\mumu$ system for
candidates where $\ProbNN{p}(p_\pi)>0.2$, a clear peak is observed at the known mass of the \Lb.
Candidates are removed by if the mass of the \Lb candidate falls within $50\mev$ of the
nominal \Lb mass and satisfies $\ProbNN{p}(p_\pi)>0.2$.

      mass, $5219.4\mev$, is observed.
      Candidates are vetoed if they lie within $50\mev$ of the \Lb mass, which is shown as the

%There are also contributions from the decay \decay{\Bd}{\jpsi\Kstarz} and \decay{\jpsi}{\mumu},
%where one of the hadron is misidentified as a muon, and vice versa.
%This can be trivially removed by requiring that the hadrons do not satisfy {\tt isMuon}, as shown
%in \Fig{fig:bkg:doublemisid}.

      %{\tt isMuon} criteria; the effect of this veto is shown with a dotted line.
    %}

The sidebands are used to estimate the level of background in the signal region.
Therefore, background
contributions are only problematic if they produce a narrow peaking structure in the dimuon mass,
because misidentification causes the $m_{\mumu}$ distribution to be smeared.
In general, misidentification is only problematic if the decaying particle has a very narrow
natural width, so any remaining misidentification-type backgrounds have a negligible effect in the
analysis.

\subsection[Possible contamination from the \xtsvty]
{Possible contamination from the $\boldsymbol{\xtsvty}$}
\label{sec:x1070}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
While searching for potential backgrounds resulting from misidentifying two hadrons as muons, a
peak is observed in the invariant mass spectrum of the $K_\mu^+K_\mu^-$ candidates.
This peak was consistent with the \xtsvty listed in \Ref{PDG2014}, which has a mass of
$(1072\pm1)\mev$ with a width of $(3.5\pm0.5)\mev$ and was observed in the $\KS\KS$ distribution
from a pion beam interacting with a liquid hydrogen target~\cite{x1070vlad}.
%from $\pim p \to \KS \KS n m\piz$ collisions~\cite{x1070vlad}, where $m\in\mathbb{Z}$.
%Figure~\ref{fig:x1070} shows the observation of this resonance from \Ref{x1070vlad} alongside
%the data from this analysis.

      \approx$1072\mev$ in data.

Initially the \mumu pair under the \kk mass hypothesis appears to have a contribution from a
decaying \xtsvty.
Figure~\ref{fig:db:x1070:2d} shows a comparison of simulated \decay{\KS}{\pipi} decays with the
observed data near this excess.
It is clear that \decay{\KS}{\pipi} decays produce a peak around $1072\mev$ under the \kk
hypothesis.
There is also a long tail but with low statistics and with a roughly uniform
background this tail would not be expected to be visible in the data after the \KS veto in the
preselection.

It is clearly not the case that the $X(1070)$ is causing the peak at $m_{K^+_\mu
K^-_\mu}=1072\mev$, which is actually due to the decay \decay{\KS}{\pipi}.
Removing events satisfying $|\mass{\pi_\mu^+\pi_\mu^-}-m_{\KS}^\mathrm{PDG}|<25\mev$ removes much
of the peak at $1072\mev$, bringing it in line with the background.
Also, the fact that no \decay{\phi}{\kk} is observed in the $m_{K^+_\mu K^-_\mu}$ spectrum, and
that the peak is narrower than the resolution of the \lhcb detector,
indicate that there this is a false peak and need not be accounted for further.
