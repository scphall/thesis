\section{Conclusion}

%At the time of writing, this analysis is undergoing the review procedure and unblinding is ongoing.
%
%The plan is to unblind etc, and then fit if find $>3\sigma$ excess.
%
%Here, a fully frequentest method of searching for a dark boson with an unknown mass and lifetime
%has been presented.
%Specific peaking backgrounds are removed before the combinatorial background is suppressed by
%applying a \uBDT designed to yield a response which is uniform in signal efficiency in both the
%mass and lifetime dimensions.
