\label{ch:lhcb}

The following chapter first introduces the \lhc and the \lhcb detector before going on to briefly
describe data collection and processing.
This will include a description of \pid at the \lhcb detector, triggering and event simulation.

\section{The \lhc}
The \lhc is a $27\km$ circumference particle accelerator which spans the Franco-Swiss border, and
is the most recent addition to \cern's accelerator complex, and is designed to accelerate protons
upto $14\tev$ and collide them.
Protons are delivered to the \lhc synchrotron ring by from the \sps with an energy of $450\gev$.
They are then accelerated such that they collide with a centre-of-mass energy of $8(7)\tev$ in
2012(2011) and a maximum luminosity of $2\e{32}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.
Particles are collided at four interaction points where the detectors \atlas, \alice, \cms and
\lhcb are located.


%Protons and heavy ions are injected into the \lhc at $450\gev$ from the \sps, and then accelerated
%to energies on the \tev scale before colliding them at one of four interaction points around the
%ring.
%The \lhc is designed to collide protons every $25\ns$ with a centre-of-mass energy of $14\tev$,
%however in Run 1 it ran at $50\ns$ and collided particles with energies of 7 and $8\tec$ in 2011
%and 2012 respectively.




%Typically a 2012 (2011) fill of the \lhc collided protons with a centre-of-mass energy of $8(7)\tev$
%every $50\ns$ with a maximum luminosity of $2\e{32}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$.
%Particles are injected into the \lhc with an energy of 450\gev, where they are then accelerated
%up to the desired energy.

\section{The \lhcb detector}

Modern high energy flavour physics experiments usually study the decays of particles containing
\bquark or \cquark quarks.
These paritcles typically travel around $\cm$ before decaying into some combination of leptons and
hadrons.
A detector designed for flavour physics, therefore, must be able to resolve decay vertices
at which \bquark and \cquark containing hadrons decay, and then reconstruct and identify the particles
into which they decay.
The \lhcb detector is just such an apparatus, where the above requirements drove its design.
\lhcb is a single-arm forward spectrometer, meaning that while
the reconstruction of non-interacting particles, such as neutrinos, is difficult, there is room for
a precise vertex detector and \pid systems which are absent from modern general purpose detectors.

%Detector geometry and subdetector layout are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:lhcb:lhcb},
Figure~\ref{fig:lhcb:lhcb} shows the \lhcb detector layout with subdetector systems indicated.
The \lhcb $z$ coordinate is defined by the \lhc beam pipe which passes through the centre of the
detector, the $x$ and $y$ coordinates are then the horizontal and vertical axes respectively.
After the interaction point detected particles travel in the forward $z$ direction (downstream) through the
detector volume.
Part of this is immersed in a magnetic field with an integrated field strengh of $4\,\mathrm{Tm}$,
this bends charged particles in the $x$ direction

where charged particles are bent in the $x$ plane by a conventional magnet.
This magnet is
the detector in a magnetic field which has an integrated field strength of $4\,\mathrm{Tm}$.
The various subdetector systems trough which particles pass can be broadly categorized as tracking,
particle identification or calorimetry.

%Tracking begins close to the interaction point with the Vertex Locator (\velo), the aim of which is
%to resolve tracks in such a high occupancy region.
%Charged particles traveling in the detection region will then be observed as deposits in the Tracker
%Turicensis (\ttracker) before the magnet, and the three tracking stations (\Tone, \Ttwo and
%\Tthree) after the magnet.
%Particle identification information primarily comes from the two Ring Imaging Cherenkov (\rich)
%detectors, which allow separation between pions, kaons and protons.
%Calorimeters measure the energy of electrons, photons and hadrons.
%The muon stations provide tracking information for particles which penetrate the calorimeter
%systems, and therefore also provide particle identification for muons.

In the high energy proton-proton collisions provided by the \lhc \bbbar pairs are produced in such
away that their momentum vectors point along the beam axis; this is shown in shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:lhcb:bbbar}.
This motivates the \lhcb detector's asymmetric design, the acceptance being from
$15\mrad$ to Â£$300(250)\mrad$ in the bending (non-bending) plane.
This equates in pseudo-rapidity, $\eta$, to approximately $2<\eta<5$ where:
\begin{equation}
  \eta = -\log\left(\tan\frac\theta2\right),
\end{equation}
and $\theta$ is the angle between a particle's momentum vector and the positive $z$ direction.
This detection region is sufficient to cover nearly 50\% of \bquark quarks produced.
%The asymmetric design of the \lhcb detector is unique among high energy physics experiments...

\subsection{Tracking}
The proton-proton interaction point is surrounded by the \velo.
This is a very high multiplicity region and therefore a high resolution required is provided by the
\velo.
Resolving tracks here is not only important to identify the primary vertex (PV), but also the
secondary vertex indicative of long lived particles that decay via the Weak interaction, which is
vitally important for the \lhcb physics program.
The \velo enables this by getting very close to the beam line and a high resolution, courtesy of
silicon strip detection layers working in $(r,\phi)$ coordinates.

There are 42 of each the $r$ and $\phi$ sensors in the \velo, organized into 21 detection layers,
with an additional four $r$ upstream sensors for pile-up veto.
\bam{Pile-up veto here.}
Each of these layers is split into two haves which can retract during \lhc beam injection, and then
close when beams are declared stable.
This movement allows the detection region to begin $8\mm$ from the beam centre, reducing track
extrapolation back to the primary vertex.
Particles emerging from the primary vertex in the range $1.6<\eta<4.9$, and $|z|<10.6\cm$ can be
detected in the \velo.
The pitch of the silicon strips varies from $\sim40\mum$ closest to the beam, to $\sim100\mum$
and has an impact resolution of $20\mum$ for high momentum tracks.
The geometry of the \velo is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:lhcb:velo}.

%The tracking system begins with the \velo.
%Resolving tracks coming from the interaction region is vitally important for the \lhcb physics
%program.
%The \velo surrounds the interaction region with high resolution silicon strip detectors with
%cylindrical $(r,\phi)$ coordinates.

    Along side these are slices in the $(x,y)$ plane, with the \velo closed and open.

  \label{fig:lhcb:velo}
\end{figure}


Tracking continues with four tracking stations, the \ttracker is located
before the magnet, and the remaining stations (\Tone, \Ttwo and \Tthree) are downstream of the magnet.
Each of these consists of four layers of strip detectors orientated in $(x, u, v, x)$, where $u$
and $v$ are rotated $\pm5^\circ$ with respect to $x$.
The tracking stations after the magnet (T1-3) are each comprised of two detectors: an inner
tracker (\intr), covering the high occupancy area nearest the beam pipe; and an outer tracker (\ot)
covering the remainder.
Together with the \ttracker, the \intr forms the Silicon Tracker (\st).
The \ot is composed of straw-tube modules, each containing two layers of drift-tube detectors.
Directly before the magnet is the \ttracker which, together with the \intr, forms the Silicon
Tracker (\st).

The combination of the tracking systems results in a momentum resolution of $\Delta p/p$ varying
from $0.4\%$ at $5\gev$ to $0.6\%$ at $100\gev$.

\section{RICH and PID}
Another essential requirement of the \lhcb detector is the ability to distinguish between pions, kaons and
other charged particles that do not decay within the detector volume.
This is achieved with information gathered by two \rich detectors;
\richone is located immediately downstream of the \velo and \richtwo is downstream of the tracking
stations.

Cherenkov radiation is electromagnetic radiation emitted when a charged particle passes through a
dielectric medium (insulator which can be polarized by an electric field) at a speed greater than
the phase velocity of light in that medium.
Cone of light is emitted the angle of which is proportional to the particle's velocity:
\begin{equation}
  \cos\theta_\mathrm{Ch}=\frac1{n\beta}, \beta=\frac{v_p}{c}.
\end{equation}
In \lhcb's \rich detectors this cone of light is reflected and focused by spherical mirrors onto
arrays of Hybrid Proton Detectors (HPDs) outside of the detection volume.
The hits in the HPDs are then fitted to circles in order to measure the angle $\theta_\mathrm{Ch}$,
and thus the velocity of the particle that created it.
With the information about the particle's momentum from the tracking system (and magnet)
a likelihood is produced based on the predicted $\theta_\mathrm{Ch}$ for given particle hypotheses.

Two \rich detectors are needed in order to perform particle identification to particles with a
range of momenta.
\richone contains two radiators: Aerogel and \cfourften, which are denser than the \cffour in
\richtwo, and is therefore sensitive to lower momentum tracks; $\sim1-60\gev$ in comparison to
$15-100\gev$.
Their particle identification abilities are outlined in Fig~\ref{fig:lhcb:richpid}, where
theoretical Cherenkov angles are show for a particle of given momentum, alongside

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Calorimeters}
Main purpose of the \lhcb calorimeter system is to measure the position and energy of hadrons,
electrons and photons for use in the \lone trigger.
%Primary objective is for fast readout.
The first elements of the calorimeter are the \spd and the \presh which surround a plate of lead.
Together these give electron-photon separation as the scintillating material only interacts with
charged particles.
After the \spd/\presh combination come the \ecal and \hcal.
Both of these consist are of the shashlik design, that is alternating layers of scintillator and
lead.
The design energy resolution of the \ecal is $\sigma_E/E = 10\%/\sqrt{E} \oplus 1\%$ (E in GeV)
and the resolution of the \hcal is $\sigma_E/E = (69\pm5)\%/\sqrt{E} \oplus (9\pm2)\%$ (E in GeV).



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Muon detectors}
The final subdetector is the muon system which is used for tracking, triggering and \pid.
Each of the five muon stations (M1-5) are comprised of regtangular detection areas with higher
resolution in the bending plane than in the non-bending plane, each consectutive muon station is
also larger than the previous (in order to cover the same angular acceptance).
The first muon station is unique, is only used for tracking and triggering and is positioned
upstream of the colorimeters.
The remaining muon stations being downstream of the calorimeters and separated by $80\cm$ thick
sheets of iron absorbers.

The muon stataions can be divided up into three sections: M1 is the only station upstream of the
calorimeters and is used primarily for the trigger, though also in muon reconstruction; M2-3 also
have high spacial resolution; M4-5 have limited spacial resolution, and are used instead to detect
highly penetrating particles.
Other than these differences, each muon station is roughly the same, covering an angular acceptance
of $20(16)\mrad$ to $306(258)\mrad$ in the bending (non-bending) plane.
They also have higher resolution in the bending plane to increase the resolution of the measured
muon momenta.




\section{Particle identification}
As mentioned \pid is a vital part of \lhcb's physics program.
Tracking system provies detailed info about (charged particle) tracks passing through the \rich
radiators.
Exact eEmission point(s) of photons are unknown for each track, midpoint of passage through
radiator is taken.
Candidate photons  for wach track are determined by combining the photon wmmission poihnt with the
measured hit positiosn of photions.
Once phopton candidatees are assigned, Cherenkov angle can be computed.
Fill analytican solution of the RICHJ optics is used, reconstrincting the trachector onf the photon
throughh the \rich optical system, taking into account the knowledge of mirrors and HPDs.


%This paragraph is from \cite{LHCb-DP-2012-003}.
Cherenkov angle is combined with track momentum from the tracking system.
Overall log-likelihood approach is used, all tracks in both rich detectors are considered
simultaineously, allowing for optimal overlapping oc Cherenkov cones.
Begin with all particles will null \pid hypothesis (that of the pion), overall event likelihood,
computed from the distribution of photon hits, the assiciated tracks ant their errors is then
calcilated for this set of hypotesis. Then for each track in turn, the likelihood is recomputed
changing the mass hypothesis to that of pi, e, K, p, $\mu$; leaving all others unchanged.
the change in mass hypotheses amongst all tracks that gives the largest increase in the eveny
likelyhood is identified and the mass hoyypthesis for that treack is set to its preferred  value.
This is repeated until all tracks have been set to their optimat hypotheses and no further
improvement in the event likelihood is found.
Final measure is the delta log-likelihood, from pion to all others.

Further PID for muons is provided by the \lhcb muon system, the criteria that is required is that
of {isMuon}...
\begin{itemize}
  \item What is isMuon?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $p\in[3,6]\gev$ require M2 and M3
      \item $p\in[6,10]\gev$ require M2 and M3 and (M4 or M5)
      \item $p\in[10,)\gev$ require M2 and M3 and M4 and M5
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Triggers}
Triggering is an essential part of the operation of \lhcb, and is necessary to reduce the vast
amount of data produced to a manageable amount that can be written to tape.
With the 2011 and 2012 running conditions the proton bunch spacing wasa $50\ns$, giving an
interaction rate of $40\mhz$, with an average number of interactions per bunch crossing of $\mu=1.6$.

In order to best trigger events a double layer system is employed.
Firstly the Level-0 (\lone) hardware trigger reduces the rate to $1\mhz$, then software triggers
reduce the rate to a total output of $5\khz$ being written to disk.

The First Level Trigger (\lone) is the hardware trigger stage operates at the bunch crossing
frequency of the \lhc.
The \lone hadron trigger takes information from the  \spd, \ps, \ecal and \hcal.
These four detectors offer differentiation between electrons, photon and hadron showers.
The quantity triggered on is the transverse energy, $E_T$.
At least one candidate above threshold (LOElecton, L0Hadron, L0Photon).
Muon trigger: Each quadrant of the muon station identifies the first and second most transverse
momentum.
Processors search for hits that define a straight line trough the five muon stations and that point
towards the interaaxtion oiunti in the yz plane.
In the xz plane the search is limited to muons with pt>0.5\gev.
The position of a track in the first tewo station sallow the determonasion of hits pt.
The trigger sets a single threshold on either the largest py of the 8 candidates (L0Mon) of a
threshold on pTpargest x ptsecond largest (L0Dimuon) (of the 8 candidated)




\begin{itemize}
  \item The bunch crossing is $40\,MHz$, clearly this can not all be recorded
  \item \lhcb was designed for instantaneous luminosity of $2\e{32}$, during
    running period of 2012 this was doubled to $4\e{32}$, possible because of
    excellent performance of detector hardware and trigger system. In such
    conditions, the average number of visible interactions per bunch crossing is $\mu=1.6$
  \item Also a lot of interactions are rubbish
  \item Triggers select events that are most likely to be of interest
  \item LHCb plans to run at $2\e{32}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$
  \item Defocussed, so we see 10MHz (numbers need checking)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Software triggers}
\begin{itemize}
  \item HLT1
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Partial event reconstruction and an inclusive selection of signal
        candidates.
    \end{itemize}
  \item HLT2
    \begin{itemize}
      \item At the reduced rate of 80kHz (2012)
      \item performs full event reconstruction
      \item Inclusive and exclusive selections reduces the trigger rate to
        5kHz, which are saved for later offline analusus (2012)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Muon triggers}
\begin{itemize}
  \item L0Muon
  \item M1-5 split into quadrants, each quadrant contains elemets from all Mx stations
  \item from each quadrant get first and second greatest pt
  \item different resolutions in zx and zy planes
  \item L0Muon cuts on ptlargest, and L0DiMuon cuts on ptlargest x ptsecond
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Deferred triggering}
The concept of deferred triggering was new to the \lhcb triggering system in 2012.
It consisted of Storing some events that pass the \lone trigger on hard disks temporoarily until
the end of the fill, and then processing the event with the \hlt.



\section{Simulation}
The \lhcb simulation is a three step process: first $pp$ collisions are generated, then subsequent
decays are simulated and finally they are reconstructed.
Simulation is done using pythia...


Simulation of events at the \lhcb  detector is a multi-stage process involving generation,
simulation and reconstructio...n



\section{Stripping}
The high output rate of the \lhcb trigger means that there is a huge amount of data to be made
accessible to collaborators, too much to be convenient, in fact.
Because of \lhcb's wide physics program it is possible to run further collaboration wide selection
twice a year to reduce the dataset by approximately a factor of ten.
Within each of these data-subsets further stripping flags are applied which further increase the
speed which a dataset can be processed.
The stripping lines used in this thesis are the Dimuon line and the
