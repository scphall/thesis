\subsection{Muon systems}


Muons are the only charged particles that interact weakly enough to pass through the calorimeter
system.
Muons contribute to the final state of many $b$-hadron decays, including \lhcb{'s} flagship
measurements of  the branching fraction \decay{\Bs}{\mumu} and the angular analysis of
\decay{\Bd}{\Kstarz\mumu}.
The muon system is designed to give precise measurements of muon trajectories and triggering of
decays with muons in the final state.

The muon system consists of five muon stations, M1--5.
The first station, M1, is located directly upstream of the calorimeters; the other stations are all
downstream of the calorimetry system and are interleaved with $80\cm$ thick iron absorbers.
The layout of the \lhcb muon system is shown in \Fig{fig:lhcb:muonside}.

      Side-on view of the LHCb muon system.
      The M1 station is located upstream of the calorimeters, and M2--5 are all downstream.
      Relative scales are the same, but absolute dimensions scale with distance from the $pp$
      interaction point, such that the angular coverage is identical for each station.
      Between stations M2--5 are $80\cm$ thick iron filters.
      Regions R1--4 indicate areas of equal flux, the resolution changes accordingly, being courser
      grained further from the beam line, this is shown clearly in
      Fig.~\protect\ref{fig:lhcb:muonpad}.

Each station uses Multi-Wire Proportional Chambers, except for the centre of M1, where
the expected muon flux would age this technology too quickly; in this area Gas Electron Multiplier
detectors are used.
Detector resolution is defined by rectangular logical pads, which have varying spacial resolutions,
becoming coarser as the distance from the beam axis increases.
These regions are discretised, and labelled R1--4 as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:lhcb:muonpad},
where the segmentation ratios for $\mathrm{R}1:\mathrm{R}2:\mathrm{R}3:\mathrm{R}4$ are $1:2:4:8$,
such that the occupancy in each region is approximately equal.
The number of detection cells in the bending plane is greater than in the non-bending plane, in
order to increase the momentum resolution.
The inclusion of the M1 station is primarily to provide improved momentum resolution in the
trigger, giving a momentum resolution of approximately $20\pc$.
In total, the absorber material is 20 interaction lengths, such that only highly penetrating muons
reach M4--5; in order to pass through all the muon stations a muon must have a \pt of at least
$6\gev$.
Therefore, stations M1--3 have considerably better spacial resolution than stations M4--5, which
are primarily used to identify highly penetrating muons.

      Each chamber comprises a logical pad structure as shown for M1 in the right-hand diagram.
      The resolution for the stations in M2--3(M4--5) are double(half) that of M1.

The muon system provides important \pid information.
In many \lhcb analyses a muon is identified based on hits within the muon system; this criterion is
known as \ismuon.
This criterion is boolean, and its exact response is defined by the muon momentum, which
is explicitly given in \Tab{tab:lhcb:ismuon}.
%The criteria is dependent upon the muon momentum, and defined exactly in \Tab{tab:lhcb:ismuon}.

\begin{table}
  \caption[Conditions to satisfy the {\tt isMuon} criteria]
  {
    The \ismuon flag is an important variable used to identify muons.
    The criterion depends on the particle's measured momentum.
    If the \ismuon condition returns a true then the particle is identified to be a muon.
