\chapter{The LHCb experiment}
\label{ch:lhcb}

The following chapter first introduces the \lhc and the \lhcb detector before briefly
describing data collection and processing.
This will include a description of \pid at the \lhcb detector, triggering and event simulation.

\section{The LHC}
The \lhc is a superconducting synchrotron which can simultaneously accelerate beams of proton bunches
in opposite directions.
Physically, the \lhc is located at \cern, near Geneva, Switzerland; it is 27\km in
circumference and spans the Franco-Swiss border at a depth of about 100\m.
Protons are supplied to the \lhc from the \sps with an energy of 450\gev, they can then
be accelerated and collided with a design centre of mass energy of 14\tev.
In the years 2011 and 2012 the centre of mass energy was 7 and $8\tev$ respectively.
Once the desired energy is reached the beams are collided at four interaction points, \lhcb is
situated at one of them.
Collisions of proton bunches occur every 50\ns reaching luminosities of up to
$7\e{33}\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, however the beams entering \lhcb must be defocused, to
$3(4)\e{33}\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ in 2011(2012), in order to reduce occupancy in the
\lhcb detector.
These high energy collisions produce a vast number of \bbbar pairs which subsequently hadronize
into \bquark hadrons, it is the prospect of studying these bound states of \bquark (and other heavy
flavour) quarks that has motivated the design of the \lhcb detector.
