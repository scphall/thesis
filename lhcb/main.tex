\chapter{The LHCb experiment}
\label{ch:lhcb}

The following chapter first introduces the \lhc and the \lhcb detector before briefly
describing data collection and processing.
%This will include a description of \pid at the \lhcb detector, triggering and event simulation.
Other important features, such as particle identification and triggering, of the \lhcb experiment
will also be outlined.
