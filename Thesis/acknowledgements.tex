    I would like to begin by expressing sincere gratitude towards my supervisor, Prof.~Andrey Goutvin,
    for the guidance and help he bestowed on me throughout my Ph.D.
    Other people who offered invaluable help and suffered me gladly, included
    Mike Williams,
    Christoph Langenbruch,
    Sebastian Neubert,
    Mitesh Patel, and
    Kostas Petridis.
    Without these individuals, this thesis would not have been possible.

    I must also thank my pals, Sam Cunliffe, Robyn Lucas, Patrick Owen and Eluned Smith for being
    my islands of sanity while on long
    term attachment to \cern.
    They were also constant sources of entertainment throughout my Ph.D.

    Other friends that have been of immesurable value over the last few years include

    Lastly I must thank my family, for their relentless encouragement and support throughout my
    life.
