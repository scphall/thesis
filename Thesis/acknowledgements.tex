    I would like to begin by expressing sincere gratitude towards my supervisor, Prof.~Andrey
    Goutvin, for the guidance and help he bestowed on me throughout my Ph.D.
    Other people who offered invaluable help and suffered me gladly, included
    Mike Williams, Christoph Langenbruch, Sebastian Neubert, Mitesh Patel, and
    Kostas Petridis.
    Without these individuals, this thesis would not have been possible.

    I must also thank my pals, Sam Cunliffe, Robyn Lucas, Patrick Owen and Eluned Smith for being
    my islands of sanity while on long
    term attachment to \cern.
    They were also constant sources of entertainment throughout my Ph.D.

    To list the normal, non-physicist, friends that have popped up and been of immeasurable value
    over the last few years would not be a little cheesy and, frankly, make a tedious read.
    You know who you are.

    Lastly, I must thank my family, for their relentless encouragement, support, and
    unsubstantiated belief in me throughout my life.
