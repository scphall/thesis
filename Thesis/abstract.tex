\hspace{5em}\begin{verse}
as freedom is a breakfastfood\\
and truth can live with right and wrong\\
and molehills are from mountains made\\
---long enough and just so long\\
will being pay the rent of seem\\
and genius please the talentgang\\
and water most encourage flame\\
\vspace{1em}

as hatracks into peachtrees grow\\
and hopes dance best on bald men's hair\\
and every finger is a toe\\
and every courage is a fear\\
---long enough and just so long\\
will the impure think all things pure\\
and hornets wail by children stung\\
\vspace{1em}

as the seeing are the blind\\
and robins never welcome spring\\
nor flatfolk prove their world is round\\
nor dingsters die at break of dong\\
and common's rare and millstones float\\
---long enough and just so long\\
tomorrow will not be too late\\
\vspace{1em}

worm is the word and joy is the voice\\
down shall go which and up come who\\
breasts will be breasts and thighs will be thighs\\
deeds cannot dream what dreams can do\\
---life is a tree (this life one leaf)\\
love is the sky and I am for you\\
just so long and long enough\\
