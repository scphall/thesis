\section{Calculation of the branching fraction}
\label{sec:dsphi:bf}
The branching fraction of the decay \btodsphi is determined with respect to the normalization
channel \btodsd, where $\decay{\Dz}{\Km\pip}$, using
\begin{equation}
  \BF\big(\btodsphi\big) =
  \frac{\varepsilon\big(\decay{\Bp}{\Ds\Dzb}\big)}{\varepsilon\big(\btodsphi\big)}
  \cdot
  \frac{\BF\big(\decay{\Dzb}{\Km\pip}\big)}{\BF\big(\phitokk\big)}
  \cdot
  \frac{N\big(\btodsphi\big)}{N\big(\decay{\Bp}{\Ds\Dzb}\big)}
  \cdot
  \BF\big(\btodsd\big)
  , \\
  \label{eq:dsphi:bf}
\end{equation}
where $N$ denotes a yield and $\varepsilon$ denotes an efficiency.
This choice of normalization channel means that the values of the branching fraction
$\decay{\Ds}{\kkpi}$, which has a $5\pc$ uncertainty, cancels.
%Reference~\cite{LHCb-CONF-2012-009} details an analysis including the decay \btodsd
%is measured with an --- almost --- identical selection.
%Values for the normalizaton channel were previoiusly calculated in \Ref{LHCb-CONF-2012-009}.

\subsection{Efficiency calculations}
Efficiencies relevant to the calculation of the
branching fraction, given in \Eq{eq:dsphi:bf}, were
calculated using simulated events of the decays \btodsphi and \btodsd.
A summary of these efficiencies can be found in \Tab{tab:dsphi:eff}.

The majority of the efficiencies listed in \Tab{tab:dsphi:eff} are calculated using simulated
\btodsphi events.
However, calculating the efficiency of the BDT variable using simulated events is not reliable,
because of the number of PID --- and other --- variables that are poorly described by simulation.
Therefore, the value of \eff{BDT} is determined with a data driven method.

To obtain the BDT efficiency the validation sample for each BDT is taken, and binned in three
dimensions: \pt, \chisqfd, and BDT.
The variables \pt and \chisqfd are used because they are two of the most powerful variables in the
\bdt and well described by simulation.
The large statistics of the validation sample mean that in each bin defined by \pt and \chisqfd
there is a BDT distribution.
Then, each individual simulated event is assigned an efficiency based on the BDT distribution in
the bin defined by the \pt and \chisqfd of the \Ds or \phii.
These individual efficiencies can then be amalgamated into an overall efficiency.
This method is also used in \Ref{LHCb-PAPER-2012-001}.

Figure~\ref{fig:dsphi:fits} shows the results of the fit of the signal and background functions to
the \btodsphi candidates from data.
The total signal yield gives a value of $N\big(\btodsphi\big)=6.7\,^{+4.5}_{-2.6}$, with a
statistical significance of $3.6\stdev$, as calculated using Wilks Theorem~\cite{wilks1938}.
This is confirmed with an ensemble of $10^5$ toy datasets.

Using \Eq{eq:dsphi:bf}, the branching fraction of the decay \btodsphi was determined to be
\begin{equation}
  \BF\big(\btodsphi\big) =
  \big(1.87\,^{+1.25}_{-0.73}\stat\pm0.19\syst\pm0.32\normerr\big)\e{-6}.
  \label{eq:dsphi:result}
\end{equation}
This assumes the branching fraction values of
$\BF\big(\btodsd\big)=\big(1.00\pm0.17\big)\e{-2}$,
$\BF\big(\decay{\Dzb}{\Km\pip}\big)=\big(3.88\pm0.05\big)\e{-2}$, and
$\BF\big(\phitokk\big)=\big(48.9\pm0.5\big)\e{-2}$~\cite{PDG2012}.
The uncertainties in the branching fraction of the normalization channel introduced a systematic
uncertainty of $17\pc$.
Other systematic uncertainties are included in the above result, and are discussed in
\Sec{sec:dsphi:syst}.
The above result has a branching fraction which is higher than the SM predictions, although there
are large uncertainties associated with both the theoretical and experimental values.
