LIST

The \decay{\Ds}{\kkpi} and \decay{\phi}{\kk} candidates are required to have invariant masses
within 25 and $20\mev$ of their known masses~\cite{PDG2012} respectively.



Boosted Decision Trees were trained using the bagging method, as described in \Sec{sec:bdt:bag}, to
identify the decays \decay{\Ds}{\kkpi} and \decay{\phi}{\kk}.
The signal and background data used to train these BDTs came entirely from data.
Signal samples came from the decays $\decay{\Bbar^0_{s}{\Ds\pim}$ and $\decay{\Bs}{\jpsi\phi}$
data, which was background subtracted by sWeighting~\cite{sPlot}.
Background samples were taken from the sideband distributions of the same data.
